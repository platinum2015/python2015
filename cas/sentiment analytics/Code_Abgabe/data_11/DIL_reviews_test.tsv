153_ 3	neutral	Therefore, if you have a really robust connection (like a T3), this will help.
207_ 11	negative	They have a good concept here, and I normally expect a lot better quality from Creative, so maybe they will do better with the next gen version, but for now I say buyer beware.
242_ 44	neutral	The downloads are for basic and advanced operations.
47_ 2	neutral	I've had this camera for roughly 3 weeks now and I've taken approximately 250 pictures.
259_ 3	negative	If you're looking for a new company, don't be fooled by the service plans.
206_ 7	neutral	I know this list is horribly unreasonable, which is why it amazes me how many players lack some of these basic features.
135_ 7	neutral	en I opened the box I found little more than a few advertisement flyers and instructions to run the enclosed CD before plugging in the router.
135_ 12	negative	The Linksys technical support site has nothing about configuring the router for use with a Mac.
179_ 10	neutral	Basically, I set up the box to work as "router" (!
0_ 199	positive	Also, multiple picture feature is very, very fast.
214_ 5	neutral	I had been eyeing the Creative Zen Micro 5GB as I researched various players.
191_ 7	neutral	I promptly gave the included earbuds to my wife, I'm using a pair of Sennheiser PXC250 noise-canceling headphones with the Zen Micro.
114_ 6	neutral	I now  have it as a permenant fixture  in my router table.
0_ 165	neutral	Sometimes indoor with poor light you can notice small noise.
81_ 7	positive	But like I stated, its better then a trash can, but I'm not sure if its better then the Diaper Genie.
100_ 20	negative	Yes, you may get a whiff of a smell when you flip the handle, but then it is gone.
189_ 39	neutral	It's not as seamless as if you were to use an iPod, but it only takes a few seconds longer.
181_ 0	neutral	The world of MP3 players is blinding, and since most people don't understand the technology [myself included], user-friendliness is EXTREMELY IMPORTANT.
132_ 34	neutral	They have the nerve to charge you $30 for a warrantied iPod.
135_ 22	positive	But the product iself is great.
70_ 6	positive	Whether you are using disposable or cloth diapers, this is the truly the only diaper pail to get!
132_ 12	negative	Also, the battery's AREN'T USER REPLACEABLE.
239_ 3	positive	Handsfree future is good, but not too exciting.
196_ 5	positive	By focusing exclusively on quality rather than excessive marketing, they have introduced a player that can look the Ipod straight in the eye and not flinch.
137_ 3	positive	New firmware update allows for automatic wireless network configuration.
107_ 9	negative	The only complaint I have is that the 1/4" collet will not sufficiently hold any of my 1/4" bits.
133_ 3	positive	It works great, i am usually at the full 54 mbps, although every now and then that drops to around 36 mbps only because i am 2 floors below where the router is.
174_ 18	neutral	WEP encryption is weak but most computer people couldn't figure out how to break it.
190_ 15	negative	Cranking the master volume level up past the mark of the bar only leads to distortion and compromised sound quality.
0_ 178	neutral	Unlike many other compact PS cameras this camera has an AF assist lamp essential for focusing in dark areas.
115_ 0	positive	I've owned this router for over 8 years and am somewhat satisfied with it.
220_ 18	positive	eball metaphor: I was hoping Creative hit a home run here, and I think the Zen Micro is more like a stand-up double.
211_ 1	neutral	I bought my Zen Micro last december as a christmas gift to myself, save for a few software issues, I couldn't be happier with my purhcase.
112_ 9	negative	If it weren't so big I would probably by another since no shop is complete without a handful of routers..
132_ 507	positive	 I am a big fan of iTunes, simply because it is terribly fast and convenient - IF you are buying the songs from the iTunes site.
18_ 0	positive	I love this camera!
66_ 4	positive	I have to say that I am very happy with it so far.
132_ 317	neutral	Whether you're on the go or just want to lounge around the house listening to music, you could definitely do much, much worse than purchasing this durable and reliable product from Apple.
322_ 5	neutral	Blessedly, my DSL was installed just about this time and I set up a wireless network with my desktop.
189_ 28	positive	The player looks SO much better when you're actually holding it.
178_ 4	neutral	I first purchased the Wireless G with Speedbooster.
221_ 13	neutral	(Like I really wanted "Hotel California" anyway.
132_ 222	positive	The iPod is not overpriced compared to the market.
68_ 8	positive	And it does an excellent job of keeping the odor contained, which the diaper genie never did!
116_ 4	neutral	I've done some hand-held routing with it and it works good for that as well.
319_ 7	negative	I tried disabling the various components provided with this product, paring it all the way back to anti-virus only service... and saw no improvement.
220_ 12	neutral	Here's a quote from Creative's web site (hoping to sell additional batteries):   "Carry an extra rechargeable battery for your Zen Micro for an additional 12 hours of nonstop music."
211_ 24	positive	best in class.
100_ 16	neutral	Pop the lid, fold it back on its hinge, pull the trash bag through the ring, and take out the dirty diapers.
99_ 9	positive	We lysol the champ every time we change the bag out and have not had any problems.
260_ 2	negative	Just don't get drawn into T-Mobile's catchy rebate.
73_ 6	positive	*holds the odor in nicely!
0_ 68	negative	Also as someone who at least knows a little bit about the technical work of taking a photo i really miss having manual controls.
226_ 1	neutral	In addition , iPods can be used as portable hard drives and can display your calendars and contact info.
221_ 29	positive	Power for the tech-savvy, ease of use for the less fortunate.
251_ 1	neutral	My explanation is that most of the reviewers are americans that live in the states .....
267_ 1	positive	1. Record around 1 hour of video with Phillips Camcorder Pro.
193_ 3	neutral	So my first MP3 player purchase was incorrect.
251_ 4	neutral	I have purchased the 6600 when it was first released in The Middle East , almost a month before Europe , and reading the brochures and features , it really did sound like a true all-in-one functionality monster .
283_ 1	positive	Anti-Spam is Good
304_ 2	neutral	I had NIS 2003 and was very happy with it; this new version really doesn't seem to offer a lot of exciting new features, seems merely the same as 2003 dressed-up to look like a new version.
217_ 23	positive	If I could, I'd trade-up on my Creative Muvo2 and snag a Zen Micro tomorrow.
225_ 47	neutral	There are bulletin boards and customer reviews all over the web talking about it.
131_ 0	neutral	I have purchased & used 2 of these routers in the past 3 years.
7_ 1	positive	This IS the best camera you can have for digital images if you want to:
150_ 1	positive	However, setting up using the quick start instructions was a breeze.
0_ 76	neutral	Personally I love it! It's a definite 10!
144_ 8	positive	As I mentioned in my first paragraph, it supports WPA security, which is far superior to WEP.
187_ 22	negative	Software The software that comes along with it is not very intuitive but once you are used to it,it  does the job well.
243_ 17	neutral	Most Bluetooth devices only support the older security system, Unit Key.
132_ 300	neutral	 I'm sure future generations of the iPod will be able to carry much more, probably even videos.
227_ 3	neutral	You will also need to download and install new firmware on the player.
222_ 8	neutral	Overall I have no complaints, this is jus!
154_ 7	neutral	running the installation wizard again.
15_ 16	positive	The panorama setting is unbelieveable !
198_ 7	negative	The support has been less than impressive, considering the cost.
194_ 8	positive	They're easy to use.
242_ 48	negative	Keep in mind that for nearly every screen, there are a number 'along side' and 'beneath' them... for every 'save,' there are choices of phone memory, memory card or sim card.
67_ 6	negative	(I never know when the Champ is full as there is no way too tell.  Even though not particularly aesthetic, how about making the Champ clear and see-through?) So, I lift the lid and find a wad of diaper, which I must remove, usually stuck inside the lid itself because the bag is too full.
231_ 3	neutral	Why is this phone so great?
212_ 18	neutral	Stopping going in circles and get to the point.
127_ 8	neutral	It is almost all you can do to change bits with two hands (you need three).
289_ 6	neutral	I was totally baffled.
224_ 0	neutral	After much research I decided that the Zen Micro was the best mp3 player for me.
53_ 0	positive	So far (3 weeks), we've had no problems with the Diaper Champ at all.
194_ 12	positive	It's rechargable and supposedly easy to replace though I haven't had to do it yet of course.
132_ 494	neutral	 I am so in love with this thing I can hardly stand it.
217_ 7	neutral	It has to be the UI and user experience.
166_ 10	neutral	The average Windows based computer, can exist on an unprote!
132_ 246	neutral	  At first I primarily used it as a stand-alone portable player but it wasn't until I decided to take it in my car and use it to play back music that I truly adored this device.
253_ 6	positive	The phone has such advantages as the excellent keypad and display, long rundown time and a good software suite.
241_ 0	negative	I have overall been disappointed with Nokia in the past, finding that Samsung and Motorola tended to have better quality phones.
0_ 94	neutral	i don't know if i just got used to my A60 or it's just really not that loud.
10_ 0	neutral	I bought my camera based on recommendations from my other friends who own it.
234_ 4	neutral	And remember, this is a PHONE first and foremost which is where I have my biggest complaints...
117_ 12	positive	I would however highly recommend the m12v router !
147_ 8	negative	Very annoying.
236_ 4	neutral	Now I'm back to Nokia to try their 6600 model.
136_ 1	neutral	What about hookup and use?
132_ 5	positive	SOUND QUALITY: The iPod's sound quality is pretty good.
287_ 0	neutral	I also reviewed Norton System Works 2004/Professional.
93_ 1	negative	I had never liked the idea of the Diaper Genie because of the refills.
119_ 3	positive	This router has soft start and runs smooth and true.
313_ 10	neutral	Buy ZONE Alarm.
24_ 1	positive	But I was ready to upgrade and when I discovered that Canon  was going to come out with an even smaller digital camera with a higher  resolution, I had to have the S100.
110_ 9	neutral	Why do people spend all that money on accessories to "raise and lower " the router in a table??? A waste of money.
132_ 42	positive	Long live Apple, long live Macs, and long live the Ipod!
149_ 2	neutral	Thinking the CD was faulty, I went to the Linksys website, hoping to simply download the setup program, but it's not available.
197_ 2	negative	The karma is only $5 more, it's small, had a 20 gig drive and supports more formats including ogg.
294_ 0	neutral	Norton has a name in the market but I think it's only the name.
217_ 5	neutral	Then what?
132_ 107	positive	  Comments: Overall this is still a great value, but is kind of overrated in the sense that there are beater deals on the market.
263_ 4	positive	i have a hard time using other phones with smaller screens!!!
0_ 183	positive	overall build quality, good macros-results, impressive video-quality, good pictures with flash (good colours, sharp results), excellent auto white balance.
132_ 270	neutral	Considering the fact that just about any CD you purchase and "rip" to your hard drive will be formatted as a WMA file, iTunes version 4.5 (included with new iPod releases) contains an auto-converter that converts WMA to MP3 for iPod compatability.
54_ 0	neutral	We started with the Diaper Genie as most new parents do.
54_ 13	negative	Now it will start smelling if you leave it with diapers in it for an extended period but all of them will!
226_ 0	negative	Why would anyone buy this when you can get a 20GB iPod that will hold 4 times the number of songs (and even MORE if AAC encoding is used) for the same price???
5_ 4	neutral	I'll share some observations that may differ a bit from what other reviewers have noted.
204_ 5	positive	I have the black one and adore it.
188_ 5	neutral	i havent used it much yet so i dont know if i will have the same problem; obviously i hope not.
163_ 7	neutral	If it was a software comaptiblity issue or a component availability issue, explain it to us so we don't have to theorize on the motives.
183_ 33	neutral	4.
186_ 9	positive	The software included is an easy installation and you have the option of using the Creative software, Windows Media Player 10, or simply Windows Explorer to move music back and forth between your Zen Touch.
233_ 28	positive	It has great upgradibility.
189_ 16	neutral	2.
169_ 2	neutral	To be honest I got it just to link up my Xbox (attached to a WET11 wireless ethernet bridge)to my cable modem (ISP Comcast), so I could get rid of the 70 feet of ethernet cable that ran down the hall.
100_ 19	neutral	It keeps smells out of your nursery or toddler room!
131_ 2	negative	My first router is a safety hazard if you do not pay attention and are not very careful.
256_ 11	neutral	This is a MUST when you need to get flight times, connect to reservations, etc.
225_ 65	negative	The Creative Zen Micro is a Zen Micro killer, not an Ipod killer.
291_ 4	negative	I don't know what's happened to Norton, but 2004 is absolute garbage.
207_ 1	positive	Right out of the box, I loved it, better features than the Ipod, great sound quality and no limitations on what music sources I can use.
217_ 22	positive	The extra spare battery is just a neat bonus.
0_ 227	negative	The controls are hard to manipulate, especially in the dark.
298_ 12	neutral	We were leary to say the least, but decided to give Norton the benefit of the doubt.
132_ 228	positive	The Great And Versatile iPod  I love my iPod!
207_ 29	neutral	Soon I will have every CD song I care about from my collection to carry around with me.
274_ 1	positive	Initially these phones were fun to play with some of the cool features like the speaker phone, web browser and ofcourse the built in camera.
250_ 2	neutral	1) phone card calling feature.
166_ 56	neutral	speed of a wired connection.
132_ 455	neutral	It takes seconds to work the menus and go from song to song.
199_ 11	positive	However, there is a more detailed PDF manual on the CD (and online) that should answer any questions about the operational features of the Zen Micro.
166_ 29	neutral	Here is where many typical problems begin.
0_ 10	neutral	I figured that the few people who reported that the LCD screen cracked on them was episodic and it would never happen to me.
85_ 4	negative	it can be frustrating and messy when you put that last diaper in before realizing the unit is full.
314_ 4	negative	I will NEVER buy their product again at this rate, and neither should you.
255_ 1	positive	Frankly, I think this is one of the niftiest pieces of hardware I've ever used.
299_ 14	neutral	They gave me a ridiculous set of steps which included emailing them screen prints as PDF files!
183_ 34	positive	) One outstanding positive feature is the battery. It holds a charge for a long time, longer than most other similar products and the user can replace it easily or take another along as a backup.
132_ 280	neutral	 This is really the only downside to the iPod - setting it up and downloading music.
132_ 132	neutral	 Sound quality is more dependant on the quality of the original source and of the unit used to broadcast (headphones, stereo, etc).
257_ 1	positive	With one of the most intuitive user-interfaces around, seamless bluetooth sync with Microsoft Outlook, support for thousands of applications for the Symbian platform which this phone runs on (I own the IR Remote, ICQ and a few others), the Nokia 6600 is all of the above - one of the few phones from T-Mobile that can claim such a distinction.
310_ 0	neutral	This is a very full featured product.
319_ 4	positive	The installation, set-up, and operating interfaces are well organized and intuitive and the email spam component works well.
251_ 10	neutral	A firmware upgrade is irrelevant .
15_ 7	neutral	However, in dark settings you must use the viewfinder.
166_ 54	neutral	Well, if your network has or will have, computers in other rooms, you may not want to wire your house for Ethernet.
132_ 431	neutral	I love it.
178_ 12	neutral	I call tech support, which was clearly overseas, and I'm pretty sure he understood me about as well as I understood him.
76_ 4	neutral	OK.
186_ 7	positive	Upon opening the box I was confronted with this small cute little MP3 player.
118_ 3	positive	The smooth operation variable speed and a set of good Jasada Bits will provide just the right combination for great predictable results.
133_ 6	positive	There are 3 computers in my house all getting wireless connection from this router, and everybody is happy with it.
214_ 13	positive	It's so cute...and behind the black panel it glows in a neon blue.
103_ 2	neutral	At first, I kicked myself for not buying one in the first place instead of my smaller router, but in retrospect I think this is the best compromise.
200_ 1	negative	The touch-pad would be a great thing if it worked well, and as I never had issues getting songs transferred to the player, I did have problems accessing them from the player.
76_ 7	negative	Solid food poop is VERY STINKY and this diaper pail doesn't really contain the smell.
128_ 10	neutral	The one wrench systems makes changing bits somewhat difficult.
196_ 2	positive	While I have not had the "privilege", as many call it, of owning an Ipod, based on the experience of friends who have had some misfortune with their Ipod (and subsequently purchased the Zen Touch or Zen Micro), I can pretty much rest assured that my decision to purchase the Zen Micro was one of the more informed ones.
193_ 11	neutral	It was one of those plastic glued containers that can take you thirty minutes to open.
111_ 2	neutral	Gave the Dewalt to a woodworking friend in gratitude for his help in moving tools to a new shop.
282_ 0	negative	As a loyal customer of Norton/Symantec products, I purchased Internet Security 2004 as a software firewall and could not be any more dissatisfied with the product (and hence the one star rating).
240_ 7	negative	Sometimes, it needs few minutes to open an application.
133_ 9	positive	Its the easiest thing to setup i thought, and i am only 16...So with all that said, BUY THE ROUTER!!!!
132_ 482	neutral	It DESERVES a perfect 5-stars.
132_ 76	neutral	iPod will change the way you enjoy music!
0_ 160	positive	However, this ultracompact allows the photographer to personalize his or her shooting preferences through a variety of preset and user definable modes.
224_ 2	negative	Within one month, my player completely died.
324_ 15	negative	I simply hate Symantec. I swear, if I could have physically ripped that software out of my computer with my bare, bleeding hands, I would have.
83_ 5	positive	And it is very easy to clean.
206_ 23	neutral	Really that's all I can find wrong with it, it took some major bouncing around to get a song to skip (there is a hard drive within), and I don't forsee jogging (wich I plan to do with it tonight) to cause any problems whatsoever (if it does, I'll update this).
140_ 16	neutral	As far as WEP configuration... make your adjustments after you've set up the router using the default setup.
118_ 2	neutral	I mounted mine in a home brew table and used a router lift.
201_ 34	negative	- Radio Quality: weak reception
115_ 1	positive	It is quiet and has plenty of power.
229_ 4	neutral	I must say that there are several factors that influenced my purchase.
132_ 403	neutral	 Not that anybody would revert back to their old-skool walkman just because you can knock it around more.
242_ 9	neutral	On the other hand, one may leave many applications open at once, hide them and return to them just where they left off - similar to a Mac.
108_ 7	neutral	Those are the good points.
214_ 17	neutral	I then registered with Napster 2 Go and it immediately recognized my player.
214_ 31	neutral	I've been ZETAZEN long before this player came into existence...lol and my player's name is ZETAZEN.
214_ 12	neutral	It is exactly the same size as my flip phone.
151_ 1	positive	While I am not happy that a solid state device died after such a short period of time, my quick review of this product space did not yield any other brands that seem much better than Linksys.
178_ 13	neutral	After 15 minutes on hold and 10 painful minutes with this guy, he basically tells me to download a file from their website which will walk me through.
283_ 4	positive	But that is good for me because Symantec softwares are a bit hard to master for me who are not savvy on computers.
91_ 6	neutral	That seemed to work -- for about 3 days.
242_ 17	neutral	As for appearance, well, that's subjective.
169_ 7	neutral	Nor did I need any settings from my ISP.
214_ 27	negative	Even when I set it to low, it's still very hard for me to adjust the player to where and what I want it to do.
110_ 17	neutral	I think I'll go rout something...
132_ 360	neutral	 I thought the clickwheel sounded great, but after trying it found it awkward.
132_ 312	neutral	It's just my personal advice but you're saving a lot of money and from personal experience the docking station is really sort of a rip-off - based on the sleek design of the iPod, it's very easy to simply lay it down without damaging it or anything.
205_ 6	positive	I imagine if I left my player untouched (no backlight) it could play for considerably more than 12 hours at a low volume level.
88_ 8	positive	Update (March 2005): My son has been out of diapers for almost 2 years now, but the Diaper Champ hung in there till the very end - easy to use, no problems with odors, and one of the best bargains among all of the paraphernalia required for the modern baby :-)
255_ 4	positive	Everything, so far, has worked flawlessly.
32_ 12	neutral	I'm still  learning about file sizes (and how large is too large to email), and I did  erase one photo I wanted to keep as I was getting used to the menu system.
111_ 16	neutral	I do woodworking as a serious hobby.
288_ 1	negative	There are some highs to the 2004 edition, but mostly lows.
0_ 47	neutral	Stored in a padded case.
209_ 19	negative	The touch pad is over-sensitive, and is adjustable to only slightly oversensitive.
127_ 7	negative	The sliding latch is does not stay in place.
183_ 2	negative	This one is particularly bothersome: Allegedly one can use the Zen Micro as a portable drive to store and transport data from one computer to another.
213_ 20	neutral	-doesn't like to be charged via USB on non windows PCs or PCs that don't have the Zen Micro driver installed.
36_ 0	positive	1- Small.
201_ 28	positive	It may not top the iPod Mini, but it's definitely an alternative if you also want the extra features and good sound quality.
196_ 15	positive	All-in-all, Creative has definitely come up with a winner in terms of product design and features, and I look forward to the Nomad/Zen line of products seizing more market share as people begin to realize that quality is a better determinant of experience than quantity and hype.
112_ 2	neutral	This was my first real introduction to serious routing and I thought that the M12 was just a router.
116_ 7	neutral	The only thing I hate (and this pretty much goes for any router I've used) is changing the bits.
134_ 1	neutral	If you have good networking knowledge, you'll abandon the wizard, use the 100-page online manual, and be fine.
68_ 1	neutral	I used to work in a daycare and we had a diaper genie.
77_ 2	positive	It definitely keeps the smell out.
227_ 0	positive	This player is fantastic in terms of audio quality, ease of use, and features.
182_ 0	neutral	Why get locked in to crappy Itunes weather you want to or not?
170_ 17	positive	Pros.1.Speed  2. Signal Strength  3.Advanced Configuration Options
3_ 23	positive	The focus is great, though, if you are not taking a macro shot.
169_ 10	neutral	to the wrld of wireless and it couldn't have gone better.
132_ 310	neutral	 If you want to add more, just delete some that you haven't been listening to recently.
125_ 3	positive	I recently had to run a 3/4" straight bit through hard maple to make a deep dado and was amazed that this machine didn't even slow down.
176_ 2	positive	A call to customer support (got to a live person within a couple of minutes) helped me tweak a couple of the settings to streamline performance.
188_ 1	neutral	i have a lot of files in wma so that was the biggest factor in my decision to purchase the zen.
209_ 16	neutral	If you absolutely, positively need over 2,000 songs for your next wolverine photo shoot, get a 10 GB player.
30_ 0	neutral	I've been very reluctant to join the digital camera communitysince I've been an avid "legacy" photographer for most of mylife.
132_ 501	neutral	 It sounds 10 times better if you use the little black foam cushions that slip over the buds.
0_ 228	negative	The LCD screen is too small since there are so many cameras that have larger ones.
268_ 26	negative	The only main drawback is the fact that the voice-dialing system is kinda picky.
268_ 24	neutral	I use this phone exculsivly with a Jabra Freespeak 250.
281_ 6	neutral	The 1 time it did install, it did not work and had errors, I used the unistall NIS icon and it properly removed itself.
132_ 140	neutral	  In the end, I haven't used it long enough to say that it is worth the extra money.
281_ 8	positive	NIS 2003 worked like a charm last year.
132_ 138	neutral	  All in all, it does what it is supposed to do with minimal frustration.
251_ 15	negative	I'm giving it 1 star because as compared to other Nokia phones , its a 1 , compared to other blunders by other companies (such a samsung and motorrola) it might be good .... but if you're getting a Nokia , don't get this one .
220_ 8	positive	I like some local stations, Stern, and NPR, and so the radio seemed like a great option.
132_ 498	positive	The arm band is fantastic and it doesn't budge even at the gym.

0_ 75	neutral	It appears that actual owners of this camera all rate it at a 9 or 10 except for those others who are certainly entitled to their opinions.
132_ 268	neutral	They were on his iPod, but the device would not let him upload the files onto his new computer; and after he tried, the iTunes software deleted the files from his iPod, assuming they were stolen (?).
132_ 85	neutral	 I use it to listen to language tapes and to play "Earl" by the Dixie Chicks incessantly.
310_ 1	neutral	It checks every 5 minutes for virus and spam definition updates.
132_ 115	neutral	It's a plug n play device, recognized as MASS STORAGE DEVICE on any windows xp computer.
0_ 15	neutral	I have called Cannon they are sending me an RFA-- I will let you know if they treat me well or otherwise.

79_ 18	positive	3)The Champ is Odor Free for at least 15 months.
146_ 2	neutral	The cheap router I used to own had very minimal feature in the configurations menu and less security options then the Linksys WRT54G.
84_ 2	positive	(You can do it one handed while still hanging on to the baby.) Also, we like using regular trash bags instead of having to worry about buying refills (like with the Diaper Genie).
214_ 22	neutral	It also comes with a case so you can either stand it up or use a belt clip.
224_ 7	neutral	I've tried different headphones, upgrading firmware, using different files and nothing helps.
213_ 7	neutral	included - charges via USB, so whenever you plug it into your computer, it's charging up.
122_ 4	neutral	I make furniture and cabinetry.
8_ 1	positive	The color and light I captured with this camera on a 12-day trip to Turkey (gorgeous vividly colored ceramic tiles inside darkened mosques) were far superior to anything I've ever gotten with a traditional 35-mm film camera.
172_ 1	positive	In fact, it supports the new WPA encryption standard, which is WAY better than WEP.
242_ 46	neutral	If you expect to be able to pick things up when you're out and in a rush via common sense, many times you'll end up frustrated.
0_ 87	positive	turn the camera on while pressing the button (or is it the menu button? i have to check again =)) and it'l show you the time and date.
206_ 15	positive	On the fly play list creation, address book, removable storage drive capabilities, sound recorder, the list goes on people, this thing is literally so chalked full of goodies, it was like Halloween all over again.
28_ 2	neutral	While he was talking, I took my S100 out of the front pocket of my Levi's and took his picture.
193_ 47	positive	In minutes I was easily navigating through the menus.
183_ 6	neutral	I have used similar devices and they are seamless and simple.
83_ 8	neutral	I'd abhor having to drive all the way to a baby superstore to purchase bags her dirty diapers are just going to get thrown away in.
186_ 17	positive	For the price I think this is a remarkably fun MP3 player.
21_ 1	neutral	The Apple was actually better in two repects: it turned-on quickly and it showed you what you just shot right after you shot it.
72_ 3	positive	No need to pay for the special refills that the other brands require!
132_ 116	neutral	No need to install the iTunes.
114_ 13	positive	Its  not a perfect system but its a very good one.

89_ 12	negative	2. YOU STILL HAVE TO CLEAN THE THING!!
228_ 7	neutral	Of course, some were better than others, and I probably could have gotten a better sound card from another company at some point.

243_ 34	neutral	I called Nokia to try to get it sorted out, and they stated that they had no recollection of ever promising to repair the phone for free.
13_ 0	negative	I left the camera in my car in Maine (not a very hot place) and the LCD screen cracked !
110_ 16	neutral	I can't complain and Amazons' service was perfect!
79_ 25	neutral	There probably isn't a pail out on the market that doesn't get smelly after a while.
131_ 1	negative	They last about 1 1/2 years until the problems start.
243_ 6	neutral	It's a nice phone, and I'm glad to have used it.
183_ 3	neutral	Ahhh! There is a catch, the manufacturer does not tell you.
221_ 1	neutral	I looked at the market extensively and took a lot of advice before making the big buy here.
208_ 17	positive	The more I use it and figure out how to do things, the more I like it.
140_ 18	positive	This is my fourth Linksys product and, aside from the rough start, I'm very satisfied with this router.
290_ 3	neutral	The only reason I'd buy them separately in the combo package is for two liecenses.
287_ 4	positive	This is the fourth version of SystemWorks and the second version of Internet Security that I have used and it has always been a favorite.
263_ 7	positive	the pics can be touched up in photoshop, and be printed at 4x6 and they look great!
132_ 112	neutral	 A sound decision and a happy customer right here!
7_ 6	positive	Travel with it without knowing you have it in your pocket
132_ 234	neutral	Eventually I had to uninstall the whole works and reinstall it from scratch, and from then on it has worked like a dream.
131_ 10	neutral	I use these routers under a table.
119_ 5	positive	It has enough power to hog out all the material in one pass, but I usually take multiple to prevent blowout and a smoother finish.
178_ 20	neutral	I was able to use t!
76_ 8	negative	I still like it a lot and am not changing it for another, but it is sort of stinky.
218_ 4	positive	I also own a retail store and this little guy easily plugs into my AUX slot in the store's sound system.
299_ 5	neutral	When all was said and done, I couldn't even use Microsoft Outlook.
324_ 7	negative	But it wouldn't let me turn the AV protection back on and it wouldn't stop with the alerts.
132_ 66	neutral	 I had to send it in for repair, and it took six weeks to get a replacement back to me.
191_ 4	positive	And so far, I have been very, very happy with my Zen Micro.
31_ 11	neutral	Scratches, oil, freckles are magnified and come out looking horrific.
251_ 5	negative	Unfortunately , I sold it exactly a month later .
0_ 117	negative	The SD500 has only been in my possession for a little over 3 months, and the LCD has been broken twice.
206_ 6	neutral	That's it.
174_ 20	neutral	Problem is sometimes you can't get a visiting laptop to work with certain encryption.
186_ 8	neutral	I popped one of the batteries in and to my surprised it started right up.
322_ 3	neutral	I decided to give it one last chance... so I formatted my hard drive, reinstalled Windows XP (which also required a day & night download/install of SP2 on dial-up) and put NIS2004 back onto the computer.
0_ 11	neutral	I received the SD500 on Monday, charged the battery and inserted the SD card that came with it, took a few pictures and waited until Thursday when the 2 GB SD card came that I had ordered.
209_ 23	neutral	Keep in mind the required upgrade may be a beta version (mine was).
242_ 50	neutral	It's a high-line Audi, on a Cadillac suspension, at a reasonable price.
132_ 468	neutral	 I bought the JBL Creature speakers for home use, and they work great with the iPod.
132_ 81	positive	 This one has a color display, which I like a lot, being very visual.
132_ 217	neutral	Given that, I find the iPod solution reasonable: keep the case sealed and let the battery be changed by a technician once every 2-3 years.
220_ 13	neutral	Try an additional *six* hours, methinks.
261_ 0	positive	I highly recommend this phone.
190_ 10	neutral	Too bad.
223_ 16	neutral	Plug in a decent set or hook it up to a stereo system and prepare to be impressed.
110_ 7	positive	Smooth plunging! ( it did stick a bit so I sprayed it w/ lubricant.
132_ 275	neutral	Also, I don't like how when I first set up my iPod, it took me about four hours to get everything going - the new iTunes software has an exploited flaw which is that if you do not connect your iPod to your PC during installation, it will not configure the iPod, and when you later plug it into your computer the PC will recognize it as an external device rather than an actual iPod, and you will not be able to use the iTunes software until you access your device manager and change the iPod "hard drive" to a new letter.
281_ 10	negative	Buying software that can not be installed normally and being put into the position of having a non-working computer.
223_ 4	positive	I have no problems with the touch pad (once the sensitivity is set to low) and the interface is a breeze to use without even looking at the PDF manual.
71_ 6	neutral	If you have a really sensitive nose, I can suggest buying some scented kitchen trash bags to use with the Diaper Champ- since the odor is contained in the Champ, once you have to open it to empty out the full bag, you're quite often greeted with a rather unpleasant blast of odor, and scented bags help with that.
241_ 8	positive	3) The joystick design they are using on the new Nokias gives you a great degree of control.
132_ 141	neutral	Do your research before you buy it, and especially talk to other owners.
97_ 1	negative	Also, diapers and wipes get stuck in the grove below the piston.
197_ 3	neutral	The karma doesn't look as sexy but it's interface is very efficiently designed.
0_ 225	neutral	It seems you have to double click some of the time, but not all of the time.
250_ 9	negative	My old Sony Ericsson T610 has this feature.
225_ 41	positive	Two: it has a removeable/rechargeable battery, so you don't have to send the thing in when the re!

139_ 10	neutral	all kinds.
55_ 4	negative	In addition, I don't believe that it is odorless.
184_ 1	neutral	  Why?
185_ 11	neutral	So Creative should be "Creative".
217_ 24	neutral	**** I gave up a ton of positive reviews to add this addendum.
243_ 14	neutral	With the recent "bluejacking" vunerability, the Bluetooth overseers have created a new security system called Combination Key.
191_ 0	neutral	I bought this two months ago at a local retailer, after spending considerable time reading reviews here of this and other 5GB players.
187_ 7	positive	The stand that comes with it is very useful to prop it up on the desk.
154_ 10	positive	I like this router a whole lot better the Linksys 11b router it replaced -- the signal strength seems ot be much stroners, seldom falling below the "very good" range (and most often excellent within 25-50 feet of the router.
190_ 13	negative	 Problems with the sound quality were evident right away, but even I couldn't imagine they'd be that bad.
97_ 5	negative	Also much less stinky.
166_ 16	neutral	You'll have to reinstall everything you put on, from the day you first turned it on.
132_ 46	negative	 Doesn't have alot of good games on it.
289_ 2	negative	So I e-mailed the online tech support with that simple question, and got a reply which was totally unresponsive (it looked as though they didn't actually read the e-mail and just sent back a few boilerplate paragraphs).
178_ 21	neutral	he brower-based administrative screen with no problems.
235_ 0	neutral	This phone is flashy and feels good in the hand, but it could not hold a connection to any of my bluetooth devices (headset, handheld, or desktop computer).
0_ 138	neutral	I Was wrong.
193_ 40	positive	I am now staring at an array of stuff including Zen Micro player, stereo earbud headphones, a rechargeable lithium-ion battery, an AC/DC power adapter, a USB 2.0 cable, a belt-clip, a stand, a stylish cloth pouch, an installation CD, a quick-start guide, and Creative MediaSource software.
175_ 1	positive	For more than a year, and it is totally reliable.
58_ 10	neutral	We graduated to real underwear last week in our house, and I'm passing this on instead of retiring it- it's too good to sit unused in the basement or dump.
14_ 1	positive	I discovered that the camera has a manual mode that gives you total control over exposure, white balance, flash (red eye, person against bright background, flash on, flash off, flash automatic).
255_ 10	positive	I actually purchased two phones recently (this one at the new Blackberry phone), and this one is far superior (IMHO).
173_ 8	positive	However since this Router is backward compatible, that doesn't pose a problem at all.
196_ 7	neutral	Apple, on the other hand, seems to have engaged in a blind marketing strategy that seeks to obliterate competition through utter abuse of marketing channels and un-orthodox "free player" schemes that just seem to pimp the product without pimping the features.
100_ 2	positive	I recommend it to both parents of infants and toddlers.
193_ 41	neutral	Next I wanted to update the software, after a quick firmware upgrade the player was ready to go.
306_ 7	negative	Booting up my computer took forever!!!
132_ 335	neutral	 I have the e3c's, and man does everything on the ipod sound great.
65_ 7	neutral	unlike the Diaper Genie!
15_ 4	neutral	A 64mb card stores approximately 100 pictures at default resolution (ie between 500k and 1.5mb per picture).
110_ 11	positive	Very good balance in the hands and lighter than most 3 1/4 hp models.
159_ 2	neutral	The only way I got the thing working (this was with a DirecWay satellite):
266_ 8	positive	This phone has the best battery, it lasts longer then my old 3210
228_ 6	positive	I have owned some kind of Creative audio product since 1993 and have never had to call tech support.
132_ 321	neutral	When I finally got it, I was amazed by how asthetically pleasing everything was, including the packaging.
201_ 10	neutral	The iPods, like most Mac products, have a sophisticated but bland, look to them... Preferrably, I like some sass.
91_ 4	negative	It still smelled.
166_ 5	neutral	What is really needed with these are plug-ins, (ever present software controls) standard from the operating system, (OS) (Windows, Mac, Linux etc.
78_ 3	negative	But be prepared to buy something else (diaper genie ?) which can trap the odor better.
132_ 363	negative	 BATTERY: Compared to the other players on the market, the iPod has one of the worst batteries around.
0_ 221	positive	And it fits right in my pocket much easier than my old S30.
129_ 4	negative	Recenly the variable speed control went out.
132_ 168	positive	 Its sleek design, large memory capacity, compatibility with iTunes, and ease of use makes this one of the best portable digital listening devices on the market.
132_ 245	positive	  Using the software iTunes is relatively simple, you just plug the USB cable in, wait your machine to detect the iPod and voila, any songs listed in your iTunes library will be transfered on over to the iPod.
104_ 0	neutral	I looked at this router and bought a Makita.
314_ 3	negative	Symantec should give us all a refund and apology!
299_ 3	neutral	After installing, the system froze trying to restart (this is a new computer with Windows XP Home).
123_ 2	negative	The speed control is recessed too far in the housing and required a tool (screwdriver or dowel rod) to effect any speed change.
178_ 3	neutral	As I'd just purchased a new computer with a Wireless G adapter, I figured I'd upgrade the router as well and set it up as it's supposed to be.
127_ 5	negative	I replaced it with a Router Raizer and it works much better.
155_ 3	neutral	I like the fact that it IS EASY to use with limited networking experience- the problem I have is that there are many useless features on the unit, and some wanted features, like a list of computers accessing my wireless, is not easily found on my router.
132_ 388	neutral	 I had the 15G iPod of the previous incarnation.
132_ 215	neutral	Ask yourself how often you've seen battery covers break on consumer electronics.
108_ 15	positive	Overall this tool is very well worth the price and I have no regrets about my purchase.
225_ 64	neutral	So, if you don't won't to void your warranty, you will have to get in touch with Creative, they will send you a rma number, fix your Zen, but you lose all of your dogon music.
139_ 16	negative	The new hardware version does not run Linux at all and most likely will not since the memory has been cut in half.
205_ 4	neutral	Originally I was only getting around 8 hours of playtime out of my Zen Micro, but now I consistently get 10-13.
148_ 1	neutral	See my other reviews for the details.
207_ 20	negative	Only slight negatives I've had so far is that I haven't been able to get it to accept any of my WAV files yet.
132_ 137	neutral	 I haven't used it to purchase any files, so I don't know about that.
290_ 11	neutral	An infected computer tried to launch an attack on mine and I was able to get a map and address of the server.
175_ 5	positive	Setup is totally breeze and Linksys's web site is pretty easy to navigate.
132_ 305	neutral	 It's a lot of fun and really tests your reflexes.
28_ 4	neutral	No, because he doesn't (can't) always carry his with him.
188_ 13	positive	i didnt get ipod because i dont especially like itunes (no music i want, but thats just me) and the creative product was cheaper; and i needed to be able to use WMA files.
136_ 0	neutral	For an item that is not even available in Best Buy and the other major stores when I went to buy it, the fact that ... has these in and out of stock, and that I received it in only a couple of days is knowledge enough to make this a winning situation.
274_ 7	positive	3) Joy stick for eazy navigation, 35Mb memory card to store the pictures and stuff.
186_ 12	negative	The touch pad does take a little getting used to.
132_ 162	negative	  * You can't turn the volume up very high, but I think this might be for health reasons. *
132_ 156	neutral	 You must buy some sort of protective case unless you want your ipod to look like some crazed animal with ten inch nails attacked it.
132_ 424	neutral	 I didn't think I would need more than the 5GB that the mini has, but... once I downloaded a few audio books on top of my CD's -- I'm GLAD I have the extra memory.
189_ 6	neutral	First of all, why does every single piece of media library software that comes with an MP3 player suck?
0_ 19	neutral	And shooters in low light should either select the iso manually and/or make sure that they don't shake much, as the camera's chip goes for detail over smoothness.
158_ 0	positive	I was an early purchaser of the WRT54G, and had a few problems with stability and speed - finally, the March 03 firmware update has resulted in an excellent product!
174_ 0	negative	(...)  Like most SOHO routers, it has nearly non-existant logging.
189_ 43	neutral	**I honestly don't see the point of buying songs from iTunes when there are so many free alternatives.
13_ 2	negative	All the camera's functionality is only available (or selectable) when the screen is functional.
132_ 459	neutral	Both are EXTREMELY user friendly and take minutes to get used to.
267_ 2	positive	2. Take around 10,000 640x480 pictures.
58_ 2	neutral	We liked it because:
170_ 9	negative	The instant setup button in the front of the router messes up the network it is better to configure the router manually.
132_ 458	positive	  I have transferred in about 2,400 tracks so far - very easy to use both the Ipod and iTunes.
0_ 65	neutral	and even after the warning i had enough juice left to finish the evening with.
106_ 6	positive	In my table the M12V has been a real champ.
279_ 4	positive	It uses the extendable MMC memory, it is perfect for storing videos, pictures and mp3s.
323_ 6	negative	I think it is a combination of the program size taking up resources and the open/close scanning that it does with every program.
243_ 35	neutral	They stated that though it was a simple repair they would not do it for less than $120.
31_ 4	neutral	I've probably taken upwards of 5000 pictures with it, it's been all over the country.
136_ 3	neutral	Having never hooked up a wireless network before, I took the advice of the quick start guide that came with the unit, and used their included CD.
297_ 0	negative	If you currently own the 2003 version, and are looking to upgrade to the 2004 version, don't.
0_ 206	neutral	I highly recommend this camera! I can shoot continuous 640x480 60 fps video until my 1gig SD card fills up!
0_ 109	positive	Having the Digic II chip helps a lot.
108_ 6	positive	It is heavy enough to make it stable, but not too heavy to preclude hand use.
207_ 9	neutral	I loved the Zen Micro, and thus it pains me to say this, but I have a hard time recommending something, when I've had two of them break on me in such a short time of owning them.
311_ 5	negative	Who wants to pay $30 to discuss a defect in a product that just cost $95? (I also bought the back-up CD).
166_ 36	neutral	Computer novices should have a computer savvy person install, and set-up their router.
233_ 11	neutral	Some complain it being a tad too bulky looking.
135_ 14	neutral	But eventually I found my way to live assistance through their site (thank GOODNESS), where someone was able to give me adequate instructions to configure the router so that I could at least use it.
318_ 2	neutral	I've seen many reviews praising 2003 and cursing 2004.
132_ 419	neutral	 I'm writing about the 4G IPOD 20GB model.
132_ 28	neutral	I just don't like it, the weird thing is, I don't know why I dislike it.
227_ 2	negative	To use the Creative Zen player with a subscription service, you need to go to Creative's web site, and download new software for your PC.
166_ 6	neutral	) that use some type of connect standard where the OS does all the work.
315_ 5	positive	5 stars all the way!
306_ 2	neutral	In January of 2004, I renewed my subscription service for NIS 2003 but on Jan 7, everything changed.
305_ 1	positive	Mine installed no problem (but I DID uninstall my Norton Anti-Virus 2002 & Personal Firewall 2002 first).
3_ 5	positive	The picture quality surprised me, when I first saw this camera I saw how small it was an instantly assumed that the picture quality would not be good--but I was wrong!
79_ 2	neutral	I can honestly speak to its worth!
132_ 179	neutral	 You  will need a computer with a six-pin FireWire or USB 2.0 port (USB 1.1
51_ 1	positive	You willdefinitly appreciate the small size.
209_ 10	neutral	I'm getting stunningly good resul!
114_ 4	positive	I prefer things that are simple.
132_ 416	positive	Also, you have to use it with iTunes - or they'll sue, dammit!  But iTunes is about as good as anything.
175_ 3	neutral	Worth every penny plus for those who are really into networking.
193_ 15	neutral	Finally I upgraded the firmware and log in to Napster.
186_ 4	neutral	I started looking at the Creative Zen Micro and after reading numerous reviews from message boards and magazines I decided I'd give the Zen a try.
133_ 1	positive	It was a very quick setup and installation, in fact the disc that it comes with pretty much makes sure you cant mess it up.
139_ 24	neutral	They have the large amounts of RAM and still run Linux.
71_ 4	negative	Opening the Champ to empty out the bag is a little tricky- I pinched my thumb a few times before I got the hang of it.
157_ 0	positive	This product is by far the best Broadband Router on the market, I bought this to replace one of those Linksys Instant Wireless B routers, worked great for about a year.
191_ 28	neutral	For me, I get through a typical day's listening just fine, and I could probably squeeze out two days, but it really is no big deal to just charge the Micro overnight.
211_ 14	neutral	Most people complain about the sensitivity, but it can easily be adjusted for personal preference.
154_ 8	positive	I haven't tried to set up any advanced features on the router, but it is not difficult to set up for basic use.
137_ 4	positive	All you have to do is click one button on the router configuration window and the router automatically senses the devices and configures the network.
242_ 35	positive	The battery life is less than stellar, but it charges w/ the quickness.
132_ 530	positive	I rarely get drawn in by mass-commercialism, but something about the iPod made me say, in the words of Lou and Andy, "I WANT THAT ONE!" I was willing to shell out
298_ 26	neutral	We'd have probably tried McAffee, but I hear from reviews that it has troubles too.
249_ 6	neutral	Go see for yourself.
132_ 423	positive	 The player is great.
66_ 1	neutral	I would not recommend buying that one.
195_ 0	neutral	If you are like me who wants move to the next phase of portable audio from conventional portable CD players I hope you find this usefull.
221_ 21	positive	The voice recorder is a beautiful add-on; not even necessary, but just an example of why Apple just wants your money and Creative Labs wants to make a better player.
132_ 490	neutral	Apple needs to step it up and get better, longer lasting batteries.
132_ 265	neutral	The music MUST be on your computer.
102_ 2	neutral	I have a mid-size plunge router already, (the DeWalt 621-a fantastic router, read the MANY reviews) and needed a heavy duty machine for my table.
299_ 16	neutral	Eventually I will uninstall this troublesome bug-filled program.
58_ 4	neutral	2. You can dump regular trash into it and not feel as though you've wasted plastic.

5_ 5	negative	1) It is perhaps too small.
110_ 0	positive	I must have gotten a good one.
162_ 1	positive	The inital setup of the router was simple.
201_ 15	neutral	The earbuds, on the other hand, are decent in sound, but lacking in bass.
7_ 4	positive	Download it fast to your computer
132_ 65	neutral	 The first one I received skipped songs randomly.
304_ 4	negative	I give it 4-stars only because the installation process - or rather problems that may surface during the installation process - can be frustrating to the average computer user.
0_ 136	neutral	When I was initially looking for a camera I thought that picture quality was my number one priority, however picture quality aint worth nothin if you leave the camera at home.
214_ 24	positive	I also like the lock feature, so it makes the touch pad inactive.
195_ 21	positive	Builtin microphone is great for recording short voice notes.
191_ 10	positive	The Zen Micro is smaller than it looks in pictures, and feels very solid.
185_ 1	neutral	I first want to say that I think Apple is making the same old mistake as they did with Macintosh years ago.
132_ 82	positive	I loaded a lot of photos into it and they display very clearly for such a small screen and, very importantly, the transition from one photo to the next is instantaneous.
189_ 4	neutral	For whatever reason. There is also a low number of people, like me, who love iTunes but want to get the Zen Micro.
209_ 25	neutral	Some upgrades are needed for the Micro to work properly with the Windows XP operating system and Media Player 10.
132_ 86	positive	It comes with an adapter to plug into the wall, which I hear is a step up from the other iPods, which require you plug it into a computer to charge it.
251_ 3	neutral	So no wonder a lot of people find the 6600 such a miracle .
129_ 11	positive	For the price I don't think you can beat it.
207_ 13	positive	This is my first MP3 player and I am so impressed with what such a small device can do.
181_ 2	negative	After attempting to navigate the clumsy touch-pad system, I could not get the unit to download my wma files.
208_ 12	negative	is not as intuitive as I would like.
174_ 15	neutral	You don't have to monkey with the PC config.
132_ 4	neutral	My friend has this unit while not experience it much, I look at other reviews on this site and tried out the unit at Best Buy, and it's definitely the most overrated gadget in history.
115_ 8	negative	If the plunging action is critical to your work, look elsewhere.
190_ 28	neutral	features[-][u][cc]It hold's a promised amount of songs, and the headphone jack/volume controls deliver a more impressive performance than creative's.
135_ 6	neutral	But wh!
225_ 52	neutral	I used them.
153_ 1	neutral	However, your PC cards should also be Linksys "g" rated, as interoperability has been a problem on some "b" cards.
132_ 145	neutral	 the packing inside was in tatters.
267_ 6	positive	6. Play Gameboy Color games on it with GoBoy.
201_ 4	positive	Perhaps I bought the Micro to be different, the cheaper price tag (from Amazon), the design, or avoiding the high iPod theft in NYC subways.
86_ 2	negative	The product also leaves a faint smell in the room.
107_ 14	positive	Wish I could give it 4 1/2 stars.
282_ 1	neutral	Here's why:
133_ 8	neutral	apart on their reviews, they are talking about installation problems and what not.
270_ 2	positive	I almost always get a good strong signal, even in fairly remote areas here in the southwest.
258_ 2	neutral	I have ordered 2 "cell phone + service"s from Amazon.
0_ 82	positive	when you learn how to change some settings, you can make the quality even better
125_ 4	positive	I could take 1/2" passes and it still didn't skip a beat.
208_ 0	neutral	I'm a new to mp3 players.
261_ 1	positive	I had a Sony ericsson T610 before this and the T610 is far inferior.
223_ 10	neutral	The battery life doesn't appear to be any!
281_ 2	negative	After 4 attempted installs, I have finally given up.
132_ 143	neutral	when i got the ipod, i slid the box out of its sheath and the whole thing tumbled out!
324_ 2	negative	Configuring it for a home network was almost impossible.
268_ 19	negative	Sometimes, various applications crash.
60_ 3	neutral	ANY Garbage bags will fit.
233_ 31	positive	The log functions helps you track down the incoming , outgoing calls in the most easy of ways.
187_ 21	neutral	The interface takes 2 secs after you press record to show up but its actually started recording at the moment you press record.
132_ 425	negative	 However, the battery life isn't as good as I would like.
0_ 133	neutral	I Was hesitant to rate it a 10 just because it seems so extreme, however I really can't find anything wrong with it.
242_ 16	negative	STYLING/ERGONOMICS: The keys are small, which generally doesn't bother me if they are spaced because I can employ a little 'Braille,' but the keys run into each other, so careful attn. must be paid when dialing.
274_ 5	positive	3) Joy stick for eazy navigation, 35Mb memory card to store the pictures and stuff.
99_ 10	neutral	Would reccommend to anyone and everyone!!
201_ 24	neutral	And if you read the description on Creative's site, it does mention that the "actual battery life will vary with use."
99_ 6	positive	The thought of not having to buy refills and just using regular bags is awesome!
305_ 2	positive	Seems to work great.
0_ 32	positive	It powers up quickly, so you won't miss that quick shot.
325_ 1	positive	Their products have been great and have saved my bacon on numerous occasions.
183_ 11	neutral	It COULD have been a great product.
55_ 2	neutral	I just go to [the store] and purchase tall kitchen bags and use those for the Diaper Champ.
32_ 18	neutral	I  would also recommend Canon's soft case for the camera, which has a slot to  attach to your belt along with a second nicely finished compartment to hold  an extra battery or memory card.
59_ 3	neutral	Save your money invest in plastic bags and dispose of diapers by sealing them in the bags and placing them in the regular garbage.
114_ 1	positive	I find it very stable and comfortable to use, it doesn't jump around or make me feel like I need to use a lot of arm strength to keep it under control, and  it has very good visibility to see your cut.
132_ 333	negative	 As with most headphones that come with any type of music player,I recommend throwing these into the nearest river, unless you like having hard, round pieces of plastic in your ears.
298_ 22	positive	We were able to obtain a Norton Corporate Edition of Antivirus only (no firewall or utilities) and so far it's great.
132_ 157	neutral	* The 20 GB version doesn't actually have 20 GB, but 18.5 GB, which makes a difference of roughly 300 songs. *
190_ 19	negative	If you've been listening to cd's in your car for awhile, dealing with the drop-off in sound quality may take some getting used to.
93_ 5	positive	The Champ works great.
267_ 4	positive	4. Play N-Gage games on it.
132_ 20	negative	 FEATURES: Really, there aren't any features, unless you call the games a feature.
162_ 2	neutral	The PC card setup was painless as well.
33_ 0	neutral	Why did I wait so long?
0_ 188	neutral	I have see impressive pictures of this camera but also some who are not as detailed as of the Ixus SD500.
132_ 195	neutral	  It was worth it, as I use it to this very day.
233_ 29	neutral	I can play MP3 files on my phone by simply downloading softwares freely available on the net.
212_ 14	negative	Verdict:  Had I not needed something with a tad bit more space, I consider this player fair game.
132_ 170	neutral	At an average of 14 cuts per CD, that's over 350 CD's.
230_ 0	negative	I don't know, maybe I got a defective one but first, the player would not shut off, next, the player would not come on - I had to send it away to get repaired.
132_ 338	neutral	 The outlook is a little clunky to use on the ipod, but it is functional.
3_ 16	negative	The zoom function on this camera is so loud that sometimes you will be unable to use it if you find yourself in a situation where you must be quiet.
319_ 11	negative	However, I suspect that many people are having a bad experience -- DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT.
132_ 412	positive	 These issues aside, the iPod is kind of like the cell phone in that once you have one, you can't be without one.
187_ 9	positive	The blue backlit LCD looks really neat and is easy to read.
179_ 17	neutral	If it is needed to make a multi-100 MB disk tranfer (such as back-up copies) it makes sense to connect through the wired network.
201_ 21	neutral	I'm guessing the more features you enable, the more the battery will drain.
179_ 14	positive	Having done all this, I was quite pleased to see that all corners I needed were decently covered by the signal.
132_ 218	neutral	No big deal.
0_ 80	positive	big lcd screen - at least for me, 2" is enough
132_ 464	neutral	That may be due to the fact that I used the menus a lot, and had it hooked up to the Griffin iTrip (The iTrip works great) for most of that time.
276_ 5	negative	and the battery life is bad !
0_ 40	neutral	Lacking a high speed/sports mode is something I'll never understand in a camera of this caliber and price.
0_ 164	positive	I don't know why CNET says there is a problem with focus, I have all my pictures sharp and high quality.
132_ 159	neutral	Like I said, I've had my ipod for six short months and I'd estimate the battery life to be about four hours at the most.
222_ 5	positive	I'm not gonna go into the features cause if you're reading this review, you've probably already looked at them, but I must say the DJ feature if Very cool and the removable battery is also a bonus!
3_ 4	positive	There is also a small covering for the lens, so you need not worry that the lens will get scratched.
188_ 8	neutral	and if you have 2500 songs, as you might very well, you will be reluctant to edit the clip properties of 2500 files.
36_ 11	positive	Silver metal case -NOT PLASTIC.
132_ 368	neutral	  But since a lot of these MP3 players are marketed on aesthetics, do go to your local store or borrow a friend's and see how the product actually feels and works.
193_ 9	neutral	The plus was the storage size but I didn't like hearing the hard drive spin.
139_ 4	neutral	They need to step up and buy an enterprise level piece of hardware for a lot more money.
189_ 21	neutral	You can buy a new battery for 49.99.
192_ 14	negative	I occassionally flip songs while working out as i accidently hit the pad even lightly (yes i have it in maximum desensitized mode).
265_ 0	positive	This phone has a nice blend of features without going overboard.
166_ 64	neutral	Another thing you may do are the many file transfers needed to playing network games.  Some settings allow you to play, but not host a game, others won't even let
254_ 0	positive	I'm sure you can read the specs above to see everything it does, but for me the best thing is that I can easily check my email, movie times, news, or any website with this phone.
227_ 6	neutral	2.
140_ 13	neutral	ite:  www.linksys.com/connect  I clicked on NetSet Assistant and let it do it's thing.
199_ 0	neutral	After narrowing my choices down to the Zen Micro or IPod Mini, I read countless reviews on both for about a week until my eyes practically started bleeding.
124_ 0	neutral	I was skeptical about this router due to low price but have been totally impressed using it.
313_ 3	neutral	I have gone to their site many times in the last two months looking for an answer.
23_ 4	positive	The camera does a great job with exposure and prints made with my professional printer looks great (not as good as prints from my pro digital camera, but still VERY good).
89_ 18	neutral	Again, this is because as their diet changes, so does the consistency and odor of their stool, in other words, it gets stinkier!!!
0_ 13	neutral	It was NOT dropped or sat on or subjected to any other trauma -- it just sat on my desk in my home office � where no one goes but me.
195_ 27	positive	The bass treble the sound detail is awsome.
311_ 6	negative	I finally got a free support number for Norton through my ISP support staff, but waited an hour or more for a voice.
65_ 2	positive	It is much easier to fill and unload than the Diaper Genie, plus, why buy refills when you can use trash bags from the Dollar Store?
192_ 9	negative	- The battery life leaves a lot to be desired.
287_ 37	negative	I just uninstalled SystemWorks and Internet Security for at least the fifth time due to funtionality issues.
132_ 6	neutral	 The Creative player sounds a bit better, but not anything to worry about.
0_ 102	positive	they made the other end of the camera flat so you can put the camera upright on a flat surface if you don't like to take the usual horizontal pictures using the self-timer.
321_ 2	neutral	I gave up trying to figure how to get my email sent or listen to streaming programs.
149_ 3	negative	I then tried to set up the router through Linksys's browser interface, but as the only instructions available tell you to use the installation CD, I had little luck - I did manage to connect briefly, but the connection kept dropping, and with no idea of how to resolve THAT issue, I gave up.
319_ 10	neutral	I purchased this even though I saw some disparaging reviews at the Amazon site, trusting PC Magazine to get it right.
140_ 7	neutral	That didn't work either.
196_ 6	positive	While I'm not too keen on their customer service (none of the products I have from Creative have given me issues), I can definitely recommend the Zen Micro for the simple fact that it does exactly what it is supposed to do and more...without needing any of the extra hype except word of mouth.
205_ 0	positive	I bought my Zen Micro three months ago mainly because I preferred the size and style to the iPod mini.
0_ 77	positive	start up is so quick �
234_ 1	neutral	Before buying, I'd urge you to actually use one and not just handle it in the store.
173_ 3	negative	Was a bit wary because the software is Windows only and I have an iMac.
174_ 21	neutral	Getting Apple/Macs was historically a pain, but they've all improved interoperability now.
3_ 3	positive	it is so small that I am able to keep it in my pocket, and I don't have to fear that it will get ruined in my pocket because it is so durable.
40_ 3	neutral	If I won't cary it around, I won't use it, and if I won't use it, what's the point?
80_ 5	positive	even did while daughter sleep and no noise!
136_ 27	neutral	As soon as you click on a site, it appears on the screen.
267_ 8	positive	8. Connected the phone to my tablet pc and now can access company VPN at 56k speed via bluetooth.
242_ 21	positive	Although it has chubby hips, the device isn't really so big.
244_ 1	negative	The photos in the address book are terribly scaled too; they look as though they were built out of legos.
136_ 24	neutral	I know I am getting specific, but the point I am making is that it does not matter what the connection speed you are running at any given moment, based on how close the base unit is to the PC card.
51_ 0	positive	I bought this little guy a few weeks back, and I have to saythat I never had so much fun with a new toy as this.
222_ 7	positive	The blue light also makes this player one of the most fashionable in the market also.
189_ 40	neutral	So yeah, you can have the best of both worlds.
250_ 11	neutral	2) Low volume on regular answering.
201_ 33	negative	Weak Points: - Touch Pad: design could be better - Volume Control: controlled through the vertical strip, but purchasing a headphone with built-in volume control will do the trick.
193_ 12	neutral	Accessories were cheap looking.
132_ 103	negative	3 No Voice Recorder-- this has also become an important and popular feature that the iPod unfortunately doesn't have.
205_ 10	neutral	With WMP10, you don't need to install any software other than the driver, which makes using multiple computers fairly simple.
275_ 7	neutral	i may have been up for this 10 years ago, but i just want a phone that works at this point.
0_ 172	positive	All the good reviews for the SD500 are true.
17_ 1	neutral	I have found however that you can just buy a card reader to solve this problem.
132_ 445	neutral	I have a ton of cds and I make a mess trying to organize them into things.
132_ 450	neutral	So far it has worked out great  I
312_ 10	negative	I am giving a zero star to symantec for this version!
150_ 6	neutral	If you need convincing on the security side, read Wireless Hacks, (this is a book of excellent tips, not just security), published by O'Reilly.
281_ 5	negative	The MS scandisk would appear due to manual shutdown and would only scan to the 2nd bar, over and over(up to 1 hr, I then shut it down and used GOBACK).
233_ 3	positive	I must add to the dismay/delight of readers this phone is simply the most groundbreaking phone mankind has ever held.
166_ 75	neutral	The purchase of a router is one of the best things you can do to protect yourself these days.
311_ 9	negative	After 10 years, I now downloaded McCaffee's product after calling their support....they answered quickly, and for free, and were very helpful.
324_ 6	negative	While I was trying to play Half Life 2 it started popping up with "alerts" every twenty seconds (literally), warning me my antivirus protection was off.
132_ 21	negative	There is no FM tuner, while there is no FM tuner on the Creative Zen (on the micro version of the Zen there is a tuner), the iRiver H10-20GB, the Rio Karma, and the iAudio X5 have FM tuners.
306_ 13	negative	After telling the rep and his tech supervisor the problem the only answer was to uninstall the program (which I had already done)...
271_ 0	neutral	The Nokia 6600 is really just a glorified 3650: you know the 3650, those bulbous, formless, big phones a few unfortunate ATT customers are carrying around.
131_ 6	positive	When the router is working it is a very nice machine for the money.
166_ 50	neutral	Still, if you think there may be more computers in the future, and there is a need for a multi-port network.
183_ 36	positive	Creative did well on its rechargeable battery feature. .
166_ 72	neutral	It is a good place for new users, who want to feel safe, and they do provide a good measure of safety, but they are not the total answer.
78_ 1	positive	First 4 months it was in our bedroom and we did not even smell any odor.
156_ 0	neutral	I upgraded my network to wireless with this router.
210_ 9	neutral	I think I'll stick to CDs.
132_ 339	neutral	   I LOVE THIS IPOD!  So why, you ask, did I give it only one star?
122_ 12	neutral	Good luck and cut wood!!!!
89_ 4	positive	I HAVE NEVER HAD AN ODOR PROBLEM!
212_ 0	neutral	Alot of people seem to compare any music player to an Ipod.
195_ 15	positive	Each battery lasts about 10-11 hours.
132_ 258	neutral	I still have my Nitrus and stand by it so far - a month has nearly passed and it's still working flawlessly.
106_ 1	negative	It's not the heaviest around (I think Porter-Cable has that distinction), but I found its combination of weight and power really too much to allow precise handheld operation.
132_ 233	neutral	The first install did not work correctly and would never transfer music to the iPod (but did allow me to register with Apple and load songs into iTunes).
195_ 20	negative	Since zen does not have an external antena it has some problems catching weak signals but it works.
209_ 6	neutral	Who knows -- you may avoid a migraine altogether.
107_ 5	neutral	I used this router to plow out 3" raised panels in oak without phasing the beast.
132_ 463	neutral	The first battery charge lasted only about six hours.
168_ 7	neutral	I bought one for my niece and will be installing it like a pro (shhhh, don't tell her I had help).
132_ 299	neutral	This is good for the businessmen who listen to music on their commute and can rely on the iPod to even carry around some of their word documents.
190_ 22	neutral	that isn't saying much, but hey, I like to be positive.
132_ 84	neutral	I'm not a big audiophile, but I have no objections to how it sounds.
132_ 522	neutral	 Yep, the iPod.
132_ 287	neutral	 I love scrolling through the menus - that may sound strange but that's how FUN using the iPod actually is!
265_ 11	positive	Along the way we compared it to my wife's T720i and the 6600 was superior in terms of battery life, connectivity bars and features.
214_ 14	positive	After installation, which was VERY simple....I downloaded any updated software from the Creative website, before I downloaded any music.
270_ 4	positive	I like the size and shape.
227_ 9	negative	This doesn't affect standard MP3 files - just subscription WMA files.
132_ 340	negative	Because Steve Jobs is a twisted individual and he made sure that he ruined this device by giving it an UNREPLACABLE 18 MONTH BATTERY.
113_ 8	neutral	Now I need to get some 1/2" bits...
211_ 16	negative	It wouldn't always work seemlessly with WMP and it often required me to restart the frozen micro by taking out the battery and restarting it.
45_ 0	neutral	I bought this camera at the end of August.
190_ 1	neutral	I'm also somewhat of an audiophile.
127_ 10	positive	Other than this, I am very pleased with the router and would buy it again.
114_ 12	negative	I also put a bend in  the wrench so I can remove and install bits from the top of the table.
0_ 38	positive	Good image quality.
240_ 3	positive	It's easy to use. Not too small, and not too big.
92_ 2	negative	The way you have to shove your fingers under it and pull is just too tight.
32_ 17	neutral	This is a great source of personal entertainment for  travelers, if you catch my drift, and you can zoom in on the LCD images!
231_ 7	positive	If you are looking for an upgrade, this is definitely the phone for you.
189_ 2	neutral	Bottom line.
242_ 1	neutral	For example, the memory card is under the battery.
132_ 488	neutral	 You pay $300 for the iPod itself, then $100 to get the battery fixed.
132_ 165	negative	 The user support service isn't too great either.
132_ 306	neutral	It's a good way to pass the time.
143_ 0	neutral	I got this for my aunt who pretty much knows nothing about computers.
80_ 2	neutral	I only noticed an odor one time and that was because I did not close thelid when I changed out the bag.
225_ 4	neutral	Now, there are many alternatives to the Ipod, but I wanted a nice design, also, and not some generic looking mp3 player.
107_ 10	neutral	I purchased an aftermarket slotted collet that does the job.
49_ 0	positive	This camera is so easy to use!
243_ 23	neutral	He advised me to back up the 6600 to a newly formatted Nokia MMC card, and restore the data to the 3650.
0_ 74	positive	This camera is bulletproof.
0_ 209	neutral	Finally a Canon with a setting for Snow White Balance.
272_ 2	positive	Another great feature for me anyway is the ability to load .wav sounds as ringers.
217_ 20	positive	Creative has excellent music software, a very responsive tech support group (they are quick on firmware updates, and make them publicly available), and usually a good array of accessories.
136_ 5	neutral	Having seen the problems that some others were having with setup, only to be resolved (some of them) by exactly following the directions, I decided to do it that way right out of the box.
0_ 203	neutral	CNET unfortunately is greatly underrating this camera in its editorial review.
46_ 3	neutral	BUT they are big cameras,  they have to reside in a large case,  they need all kinds of batteries,  in short they're a pain to lug around.
132_ 29	neutral	 Maybe because it doesn't have a lot of skins to choose from like WMP, but then again, I dislike WMP as well because it's slow on my computer.
1_ 5	negative	A larger memory card and extra battery are good things to buy.
132_ 214	neutral	 Finally, if your battery gives out, you can use any number of reputable iPod services to swap it out for <$50 and you're good to go for another 2.5 years (or longer if battery technology improves.)
213_ 30	positive	Overall though, i'm very happy with it and highly recommend it to folks looking for a mp3 player, even if it is to pretend your not a braindead consumer giving into the marketing hype of the iPod. ;)
166_ 66	neutral	It may take several attempts, and reading a lot of FAQs or network help sites to fix some of these issues.
132_ 370	neutral	 Pure And Simple, Wonderful Stuff.
243_ 15	neutral	This helps prevent people from sending short "obscene" messages to your phone.
299_ 10	negative	It was a Symantec error.
187_ 8	neutral	The belt clip however is not very useful if you move around a lot.
138_ 8	neutral	But since I do have a little experience, I simply disconnected my old router and put in the new one.
132_ 446	neutral	 The I-Pod certainly helps me with my music and I can take it anywhere with me.
227_ 19	positive	Otherwise, this is a great "alternative" MP3 player for those of use who don't want to worship the mighty all-powerful Apple.
132_ 8	positive	The bass is deep and the treble is clear.
32_ 4	positive	I must say, I think this is the coolest camera I've ever  owned!
166_ 33	neutral	online games, or downloading files from sites with different security levels.
73_ 9	positive	We keep the Diaper Champ in our daughter's nursery and her room definitely does NOT smell like dirty diapers.
192_ 13	neutral	Several people complained about the touchpad and frankly i'm starting to see why.
278_ 2	positive	Picture quality's great for still and video with sound.
198_ 6	negative	It seems like the software is just not responding.
73_ 7	positive	(every now and then I spray down the inside of the pail with Lysol) *easy one-hand use *impossible for my inquisitive child to get the dirty diapers OUT of the pail Every now and then odors do escape the pail, but that is rare--and it usually just means that we've crammed too much in there and need to change the bag.
268_ 2	positive	Among my requirments for a phone were: good screen, decent camera, bluetooth, and GPRS support.
132_ 521	neutral	 What was the biggest must-have item of 2004?
87_ 4	neutral	It's much better than putting diapers in a downstairs trashcan.
243_ 3	neutral	It was a major step up from a Sony t68i.
129_ 3	negative	It it is a bit heavy for hand held work, but any router this size will be.
132_ 353	neutral	  While I like the minimialism of the player, I try to avoid plastic products made of white- they tend to yellow with age.
95_ 2	positive	So I can't tell you if Diaper Champ will be as good at containing the formula generated poop smell, but it's excellent at containing the smell of poop of my breastfed baby!
299_ 9	negative	Like most of their solutions (which first blame other applications for errors), the tech persons line was that this was probably a Microsoft error - it was NOT.
52_ 0	positive	Works great, no odor, and uses regular bags.
97_ 4	neutral	Much more hands off and takes any size diapers.
190_ 18	neutral	I also experimented with an adapter for the car.
132_ 361	neutral	As a student, I spend a significant amount of time on my laptop and am used to scrolling up and down on the touchpad, which made the Creative Zen Touch a more attractive product for me.
140_ 17	positive	It'll make life a lot easier, and preclude you from having to give this product a negative review.
208_ 6	neutral	You can then hook up the Zen via USB to any Win2K or later computer and use that partition to store data files.
139_ 5	neutral	That aside, this is not that bad of a product.
221_ 16	positive	No skips, and it hasn't faltered once (despite your inevitable drop or two.
76_ 1	positive	No smell, easy to use with one hand free, and best of all it uses regular tall kitchen garbage bags so you don't get suckered in to using only the bags made for the pail that are imposible to find!
207_ 30	neutral	Amazing.
79_ 3	positive	I have tried other pails, but none have compared positively to the Champ.
117_ 6	neutral	I have since used them to cut all the stiles and rails for my first kitchen.
242_ 10	neutral	Me likes.
132_ 454	neutral	   The 'click wheel' is much easier to use, compared to the previous generation's models with the touch screen.
132_ 515	neutral	 All in all, the good far outweighs the bad.
160_ 0	positive	I just upgraded to the Linksys WRT54G Wireless-G router last month and I am very happy with the quality of the product.
0_ 16	positive	This camera is truely superb.
201_ 16	negative	I've since replaced it with a pair of black Sennheisers... Not only are the packaged earbuds pretty uncomfortable, but are too similar to iPod's and can target iPod theives here in NYC.
175_ 8	positive	The fact that has an open-source firmware makes it a great option in my opinion.
147_ 1	positive	It is a nice router in all ways but one.
268_ 11	positive	And the phone has a very cool feature wich allows you to send images via a normal POP3/SMTP e-mail account.
100_ 26	neutral	At $30 we put one in the nursery and one in our toddler's room.
183_ 15	negative	) Button sensitivity: Even reduced to the lowest sensitivity setting, the buttons are far two sensitive, really takes some getting use to, and even then, it is still too sensitive.
193_ 33	positive	I do give create to Creative for their attractive design.
174_ 3	neutral	This is universal across every brand I've worked with.
110_ 13	positive	The price is incredible with the bonus pack and Hitachi's $25 incentive ( you need the code ---go to Toolseeker.com and it tells you)
100_ 22	negative	To eliminate any smells we simple stuck a Stick Up room deodorizer inside the lid.
1_ 7	positive	I'd say that this camera is perfect.
280_ 4	negative	I have used Norton for the past 5 years and for the last 2 years, the software has gotten more and more disgraceful.
98_ 3	neutral	Even the old pail hardly smelled bad to me, I think after you have changed diapers for 4 years, you get somewhat immune to it.
198_ 4	neutral	I tried the help menu that referenced GUI buttons that don't exist on my version.
190_ 12	negative	One drop from a pocket or desktop, and it'd be a goner.
83_ 2	positive	It is mindless to operate.
1_ 1	neutral	Some people, in their reviews, complain about its small size, and how it doesn't compare with larger cameras.
150_ 7	negative	Knocked 1 star off for the install wizard - it wasted alot of time running it.
138_ 3	neutral	There was a big sticker inside the box saying "RUN CD FIRST - DO NOT DISCONNECT YOUR CURRENT ROUTER".
195_ 32	positive	Freebies you get: A cradle with detachable stand and belt clip, some thing very handy and useful.
187_ 3	positive	The Look & Feel: I have the black one and the contrasting neon blue on the buttons add a very nice ambience.
220_ 9	negative	Imagine my disappointment, though, when the Zen Micro proved able to play only the mega-strongest FM signals in my area.
35_ 1	positive	I wanted standard memory expansion (CF cards), macro mode, and if possible, a waterproof housing (for kayaking).
243_ 18	neutral	This includes ALL Palm PDAs! Further, due to an unparalled design oversight, Nokia is the only device that supports Combination Key that is NOT BACKWARDS COMPATIBLE with the older devices that people actually own.
3_ 27	positive	If you are just looking for something to keep with you at all times, then this is a great camera choice.
139_ 17	neutral	Simply put, the hardware is just too small to run Linux, which is a really bummer since I found it fun to play with my Linksys WRT54G's firmware.
225_ 19	positive	The Zen plays mp3, wma and wave formats, which makes it more versatile than the Ipod.
49_ 1	neutral	I just took it out of the box, charged the battery, and started taking pictures.
3_ 21	negative	The auto-focus on the camera seems to have trouble focusing on the subject.
220_ 19	negative	Respectable, solid, but not awe-inspiring.
52_ 1	neutral	Can't complain at all!
178_ 19	positive	Second, the setup CD actually worked perfectly.
131_ 11	neutral	Outside of needing an extension for half inch bits, which is a problem for most machines of this type.
195_ 29	positive	Looks and shape: I have a black one and the first time I charged it and switched it on jeez the blue light looked so cool.
88_ 6	positive	We have never had any problems with anything like loose wipes getting stuck (we always wrap them in the dirty diaper).
208_ 9	negative	The fit and finish of the product is first-rate.
187_ 16	positive	I have had the ipod mini and it performs on the level with my sound card but the micro beats it outright.
242_ 26	neutral	Still not sure?
178_ 9	neutral	So I run the CD, and get all kinds of quirky error messages.
230_ 2	positive	When it's working, it's great but it is very tempermental.
119_ 6	positive	For the price, I am considering purchasing a spare just to have as a backup.
225_ 16	neutral	They're better than the IPOD, plus, there are seven EQ settings (including custom).
145_ 1	positive	So far it all works fine with either cable or wireless connections.
306_ 14	neutral	They sent me a link to their website to follow instructions on ridding my registry of all Symantec products so I could get a clean re-install.
242_ 39	neutral	GAMES - Java.
201_ 12	neutral	In stores, the Micro doesn't even come with the AC adapter.
196_ 11	positive	The interface, while a bit confusing at first, is very easy to navigate after about 15 minutes.
128_ 5	neutral	(I prefer 1/2 inch bits).
67_ 0	neutral	My husband and I bought this instead of the Diaper Genie since we didn't want to be bothered with buying refills for the Genie.
198_ 2	neutral	I tried to figure out another way to load the songs and attempted another upgrade with no results.
147_ 7	neutral	You have to unplug the unit to get it to work again.
135_ 0	neutral	If you're buying this product and operate on a Mac platform, ditch the CD and go directly to live assistance on the Linksys website.
215_ 11	positive	Its also smaller, and gets more looks.
166_ 57	neutral	Don't worry though, the primary computer located by the Linksys, can be connected by wire, this makes for a solid, and fast connection to the Net.
215_ 12	neutral	People are use to seeing so may Ipods, that when they see my Zen, they have to ask questions.
287_ 7	negative	I think their antivirus software was one of, if not the best, on the
286_ 0	neutral	I've been using Norton Anti-Virus in its many incarnations for over 5 years.
135_ 18	negative	What this product really needs is better documentation for how to set up the router for DIFFERENT OPERATING SYSTEMS!
322_ 4	negative	It locked during install and I had to reformat the drive and start from scratch (GRRRRRR!)
132_ 32	negative	 CUSTOMER SERVICE: Awful. Listen to this one, remember the battery statement I made earlier.
266_ 4	positive	But you can download some really good ones like pac-man or mafia wars.
189_ 37	neutral	Click on "Zen Micro Media Explorer" and then click on "Transfer Data Between PC and Device" after that, a File Explorer window opens.
113_ 3	positive	I have only used it with the 1/4" collet and a 1/2" round over bit, but I love how it starts up with little torque and runs very quietly.
93_ 8	positive	It was easy to assemble, and the diapers fit perfectly into the little nook before they make their way into the pail portion.
0_ 151	positive	I've printed several photos and the prints look as good as the screen views.
293_ 0	neutral	Okay, how can I say this nicely?
168_ 1	neutral	I'm a male and that's what we do (or not do).
9_ 0	positive	I don't believe this camera is still available. But if you can find one, you might like to get it.
60_ 5	positive	This is easy to work and easy to dispose of the dirty diapers.
31_ 7	neutral	If battery life were that big a deal, one could purchase a second battery and rotate.
132_ 331	positive	Finding all the albums, songs etc is much easier than you would think it would be even if you have 20 gig (well 18 gig) worth of music.
189_ 36	neutral	After that, you connect your Zen Micro and open My Computer.
268_ 32	positive	Especially for the price amazon gives it at (I was unable to get mine through amazon due to some credit complications).
0_ 200	positive	Very fast powerup and great speed when taking multiple pictures.
181_ 1	negative	Unfortunately, Creative offered scant few pages of instruction, which meant that I was on own from the outset.
0_ 62	neutral	I have been fairly impressed with its ability to capture decent details in low light situations such as theaters, inside a bus at night ect
0_ 20	neutral	Also ensure that the low light focusing LED is pointing at the point you want in focus - and use the focus lock (something the cnet reviewer was obviously not familiar with).
0_ 4	neutral	I've had it for about a month and it is simply the best point-and-shoot your money can buy.
152_ 1	positive	It's easy and really works, with some incredible range.
132_ 461	neutral	Two DVDs to capture all 2,400 tracks.
185_ 5	positive	Also If you want a device that does soo much more than the Ipod mini but is at the same price, this is the player for you.
132_ 336	positive	 You can even use the ipod to store files from your pc and export your outlook files to it.
92_ 4	neutral	That would be my only complaint.
231_ 1	negative	The only disappointment so far has been battery life.
0_ 17	positive	The startup time, quality of pictures and videos is outstanding.
145_ 2	neutral	My next project will be to try out sveasoft firmware to increase this unit capabilities and wireless range.
132_ 286	neutral	 The entire database is set up flawlessly and really works well.
166_ 65	neutral	you connect to play.
213_ 16	neutral	it's a neutral feature in my book.
107_ 11	negative	The Hitachi collet simply was not ground accurately.
118_ 4	positive	Its well made and user friendly.
201_ 29	positive	Strong Points: - Design: small, comfortable, curved, and stylish.
220_ 5	positive	No offense to Amazon, but I was able to find one online for just over 200 bucks (I'm sure prices here will continue to sink), and that also seemed quite a good bargain for the amount of storage space.
105_ 1	positive	But it is smooth, it is powerful, it is affordable & it has a proven track record.
225_ 27	negative	The touch sreen navigation will take a little getting used to, but once you do, and while the Zen is still alive, it's a great alternative to the marching in lock step with the click wheel commies.
15_ 9	neutral	Turn it off.
209_ 4	neutral	But, they rushed it to market, so you, general public, get to roll the dice.
144_ 5	neutral	This behavior (hanging) also occurs when I transfer large files between my PCs.
242_ 38	negative	The battery life can't be very long; let's not be greedy.
91_ 3	neutral	So, I took it to the tub, scrub it down with disinfectant.
211_ 10	positive	It fits into a hand well, it has a removable battery (this is important), great sound quality, fm stereo, recorder, smooth UI, and a feature that most unipods lack... char!
314_ 0	neutral	I read how the buyers of this product watched their computers turn into processing sloths, bought a copy and watched my 2.4 Gig XP Pro processor slow down below the level of my 750 Meg 2000Pro laptop!
91_ 16	neutral	 (Being a diaper pail, I'd prefer he not be enticed by something so unsanitary.)
183_ 1	neutral	I just discovered another con in my list of pros and cons.
221_ 27	neutral	Inferior quality at a higher price (and shoddy reliability) is not quite justified just because they have a better spokesperson.
140_ 15	neutral	Problem solved.
199_ 7	positive	I think the OS and controls are very well thought out and although I'll admit I was a bit intimidated during my first few hours with the Micro, the interface and controls became second nature after the first day or so.
209_ 12	neutral	Going further up-market and using super hi-rez audiophile headphones is probably overkill; they will only serve to cast MP3 limitations into sharper relief, and honey, you can't hear what ain't there.
298_ 32	positive	Likewise, I've heard Norton 2004 PROFESSIONAL version is fine too.
132_ 49	neutral	iPod is brilliant, but service was awful
225_ 15	neutral	Check the Zen's S/N ratio and DB rating.
