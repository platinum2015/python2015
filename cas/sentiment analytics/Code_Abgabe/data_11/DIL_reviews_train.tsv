184_ 5	positive	Creative Media Source is very easy to use once you get the hang of it, and the file transfers are fast.
166_ 46	positive	This model appears to be especially good.
132_ 194	neutral	 I was quite happy after months of saving part of my pay-check to go to the store and finally get an iPod.
228_ 10	positive	Further, the tech specs suggest that it has better audio quality than the Ipod.
301_ 1	neutral	I wish I'd done some research first....
213_ 21	negative	It has the odd side effect of the buttons only partially working?
280_ 5	negative	I am glad that I do not work for Norton.
132_ 504	neutral	  I use mine mostly at the gym, so this is fantastic for me.
32_ 14	neutral	And there are two more advantages to digital photography  which I hadn't anticipated, beyond the lack of film and developing.
273_ 3	negative	There is no way you can talk with customer care about this.
27_ 1	positive	The S100's image quality rates in the middle of its class, but it can still be a reasonable choice for students, families, or small businesses looking for an ultra-portable camera that weighs less than half a pound with media and battery pack.
106_ 9	negative	With the PlungeLIFT all my bit changing has been done above the table, although I still have to reach below the table to operate the spindle lock (and, of course, the speed and ON/OFF controls).
268_ 22	neutral	I'm used to having to restart things.
81_ 2	negative	We found that when you put a dirty diaper into the top loader, there was a tendency to get streaks which would then get on the plunger which would then have to get cleaned each time it was used.
87_ 2	positive	I can't smell anything (and believe me, this is quite something with my baby).
179_ 8	neutral	Then, the hardest bit was to figure out how to disable the router and the DHCP services so that all computers woul!
7_ 0	neutral	I have used many digital cameras.
183_ 25	negative	I have trashed this product on other opinion sites based on this major flaw alone.
108_ 1	neutral	The deal Amazon has going can't be beat and if you're considering buying this machine, do so from this site.
38_ 0	positive	I was looking for something that wasn't too complicated to use and to help the pics I post on Ebay show more detial.
36_ 19	neutral	9- Cons? Not a single one after 5 months.
132_ 96	neutral	12 hours is about average, and it has an AC adapter in the box, with quick charge (2 hours) at probably 80%... and 4 hours for a full charge.
155_ 5	neutral	Expect about 10MBps and not more though!
135_ 23	neutral	If you have a Mac, I don't think you should totally discount this product.
281_ 0	neutral	I have used Norton products in the past and I am familiar with them.
166_ 13	neutral	In some cases, you can't even get your PC to the MS patch site to download XP security patch #2 before being hit.
224_ 3	negative	(It had locked up multiple times previously, but always managed to work afterwards) This time, the touch screen wouldn't respond to me and none of the buttons worked.
302_ 3	positive	The popup blocker and anti-spam are bonuses.
246_ 7	positive	The camera and video functionality is decent, I can't see myself wasting my time with it, but some people will.
25_ 3	neutral	I especially like the way that ZoomBrowser EX lets you look at a virtual filmstrip of your pictures.
233_ 17	positive	Capacity is not a problem here.
234_ 11	neutral	You'll see what I mean ... if you have a magnifying glass.
287_ 23	neutral	Without this important feature, both SystemWorks and Internet Security are all but useless.
138_ 4	neutral	And the router itself had protective tape over the Ethernet inputs.
0_ 95	neutral	but it's good enough since i upload them to the computer anyway (and sound is good too once you view it on the computer/tv).
132_ 51	neutral	How did we listen to music before it?
260_ 0	positive	This phone is fantastic.
0_ 105	neutral	The pictures tend to get blurry due to longer exposure, but his can be disabled in the manual settings.
248_ 3	negative	The menu pops up after 3 seconds The picture takes a while to load from its slow card memory.
184_ 7	positive	This is the mp3 player with everything I need.  As long as it lasts me a good three years, I'm satisfied.
190_ 2	neutral	Mp3 players are like a blessing and a curse for people like me.
154_ 5	neutral	The whole process was probably about 10 minutes.
227_ 12	negative	The subscription files are still a little slower to transfer, but it's only by about 10% or so.
132_ 74	positive	  Plus, if you order from Amazon.com, they will exchange it for you no problem.
0_ 104	negative	Only downside is when taking pictures in low-light conditions without the flash.
105_ 2	negative	I built my own router table with a tilt up top & made a hand crank to replace the height adjustment knob & these two things make it easy to change out & raise or lower the bits.
132_ 320	neutral	However, after holding an ipod at circuit city, I knew I had to have one.
225_ 32	neutral	The features this thing has are !
96_ 1	positive	It works easily with one hand, which is important.
132_ 324	neutral	 For this reason, it is very easy to drop.
58_ 3	positive	1. It uses regular garbage bags instead of brand refills.
69_ 4	neutral	For even better odor control we would put a plug ins in the outlet closest to it.
186_ 0	neutral	I've been looking for a portable MP3 player for awhile now.
91_ 7	negative	Then it started to smell whether there were diapers in it or not.
214_ 30	neutral	PS.
54_ 8	positive	There are no specail bags to deal with or buy!
93_ 6	positive	We use regular kitchen sized garbage bags.
132_ 200	neutral	 However, they close you off from exploring the continent that is other music providers.
263_ 0	neutral	I used to work with t-mobile..
215_ 4	neutral	Also if you want to purchase music, its just .79cents per track ..... Here is my origianl review...." My wife already had the Ipod Mini when I purchased this, and I must say seeing it in action, I had some reservations about getting a Zen.
211_ 4	neutral	3It's been dropped, shuffled, kicked, and Lumbered.
287_ 34	neutral	(Intructions for doing so are on Symantecs website.)
132_ 206	neutral	Why would they let anything compete with them when they are making millions from song downloads by iPod owners who have no other choice?
288_ 2	negative	The program brings more problems than a virus, albeit not as major problems, just not what you expect for 70 bucks.
132_ 208	neutral	 And if they treat their customers like herding sheep, I see little reason to purchase another MP3 player with a bitten apple embroidered on it.
217_ 2	neutral	Finally, someone has figured out that building some smarts into the player will help it compete with iPods.
225_ 20	positive	The greatest thing about the software (in my humble) is that it reads your CD info.
0_ 146	positive	This camera is an excellent choice for an ultracompact, take anywhere device and boasts an outstanding movie mode to boot.
225_ 62	neutral	There are do it yourself sites (with pictures)that show you how to repair it, but keep in mind that you will have to break the warranty seal, which means?
166_ 37	neutral	You are really the ones that need this the most.
132_ 433	neutral	 Pros Holds a ton of music.
93_ 7	positive	We've never experienced odor from the pail.
101_ 4	negative	The collet for the 1/4 inch bits is a pain to get in and even harder to get out.
268_ 6	neutral	For the linux users out there who are intrested in my setup: I'm running Debian (Knoppix 3.4) with a custom 2.6.7 kernel.
132_ 387	neutral	Just don't drop it.
12_ 1	neutral	A 2X optical zoom (you can pretty much ignore any time a  manufacturer refers to "digital zoom")
184_ 4	positive	I love how small the thing is, and the blue glow - I've had it for two weeks with no electronic problems at all.
0_ 118	neutral	The first time, I paid $165 (excluding shipping) to have it fixed by Canon Service Center.
175_ 7	neutral	But if you want to get into networking and running wireless.
79_ 22	negative	The other pail I used started to smell after 2 weeks of use.
128_ 4	neutral	It works well with the larger bits.
241_ 11	positive	If you love your cell phone games or changing your ring tones everyday, Nokia beats everyone else.
212_ 11	neutral	They are bold colors, not the (personally) irratating toned down 'light' Ipod colors.
0_ 187	neutral	The Fujifilm F10 is probably the best compact camera for low light (ISO 400 with not much noise, even ISO 800 is relative good).
132_ 80	neutral	 The best thing for anyone to do who has not used one is to ask the store clerk at apple or a teenager for advice on how to operate it.
58_ 5	positive	3. It never smelled - at all.
3_ 15	neutral	Very wrong.
168_ 2	negative	I tried to do this by instinct and it's not intuitive unless you are a network geek.
239_ 2	neutral	Bought a bluetooth headset and it works like a wonder.
238_ 1	positive	since then, i have not found one major problem with it.
132_ 398	neutral	I guess that's a pretty minor deal, but it can be annoying.
231_ 6	positive	This is the first phone I know of that has the large bright screen, infrared, bluetooth, USB connector and a speakerphone.
255_ 6	neutral	I've synched it with my Jabra 250 bluetooth headset.
83_ 1	positive	Personally, I am VERY pleased with the Diaper Champ.
303_ 0	neutral	Product is OK; however, despite the fact that I followed the rebate instructions explicitly, I am being denied the rebate because the processing agency incorrectly claims I did not send in proof of ownership of a previous product.
166_ 62	neutral	You can prevent any, and all file transfers to your PC.
298_ 5	neutral	I agree with the other reviewer that it doesn't even deserve 1 star.
35_ 14	positive	The panorama modes are wonderful.
89_ 17	neutral	In talking with other parents, I get the same feedback - as babies get older and become toddlers, ALL DIAPER PAILS become gradually less and less effective until they are just no longer useful.
268_ 18	negative	I will say that the OS that the phone runs does have a few issues.
209_ 7	positive	Before you run out and buy an iPod, understand something: there are REASONS the Zen is worth encountering this kind of hassle, principally excellent (for MP3) sound quality.
99_ 2	positive	I actually took a friends word on it and went with this Champ when registering and I am glad I did.
7_ 3	positive	Hate to wait between shots
189_ 35	neutral	This is what I do:  I copy all the music I want to import to the Zen Micro into an iTunes play list.
132_ 196	negative	  The thing has survived plenty of falls with little or no damage, except the inevitable scratches.
84_ 0	positive	This is a great diaper pail.
149_ 5	neutral	Very disappointing.
165_ 0	neutral	Years ago I had an old Linksys router that I never could get to work right.
132_ 394	neutral	  The major change from the previous model, other than the extra 5G for the same price, is that this one is slightly smaller and lighter, and the already minimal buttons (menu, play/pause, forward and back) have now been assigned to the four quarters of the click wheel, so that even less brain power is required to search through your 10,000 stolen mp3s.
200_ 2	negative	Many other reviewers are mentioning that they have had no problems at all> I would say that the main problem is that this player is just not made very well.
117_ 2	positive	I have a tendency to do quite a bit of research before I drop money on a tool and everyone I talked to loved this router.
132_ 390	neutral	 Then I had the second one in my boyfriend's car, and his car got jacked.
208_ 2	neutral	After reading reviews and talking to a few friends, I decided on the Zen.
60_ 4	negative	The Diaper Genie needs it's own refill bags in order to work and that's just more money that you don't have to spend.
193_ 25	neutral	Immediately you could tell a very distinct difference between the two Creative MP3 players.
243_ 40	neutral	You will also hard-reset both your Palm and your Nokia to factory defaults in their lame attempts to get the script to work, though it will not.
55_ 0	neutral	In concept, it's a fabulous idea.
49_ 4	positive	The pictures are beautiful, and the camera is so small you can carry it anywhere.
139_ 18	neutral	However, if you are not a tech person and!
250_ 14	negative	Speaker volume is loud and clear but it sacrifaces the battery life.
279_ 2	positive	You can turn this phone into a gaming machine, a camcorder or a digital camera, an mp3-player, a movie viewer, a voice recorder, a personal secretary, a GPS map browser, a book, a multifunction remote controller, practically everything that you can do with the computer, plus it is a phone(!!) and also you can carry it in your pocket :).
287_ 19	negative	Almost from the beginning, LiveUpdate would not function.
69_ 3	positive	THIS ITEM IS EXCEPTIONAL I like the ease of use and it held the odor in great.
35_ 8	negative	For example, in auto mode you can't use the flash redeye reduction, you must be in manual mode for that.
242_ 45	negative	The second piece of advice - Be prepared to spend a lot of time w/ this phone.
132_ 408	negative	First of all, I've never been big on earbuds - they're just not that comfortable.
298_ 10	negative	Norton support is completely pathetic.
0_ 114	positive	I love the rounded edges now, fits so much better in a pocket, jeans or suit.
0_ 46	neutral	Camera has been treated with kid gloves since day one.
199_ 8	neutral	My preference for the touchpad sensitivity setting is 'medium'.
134_ 0	neutral	It's probably a fine router, but I found the install wizard to be of poor quality.
201_ 25	positive	Overall, the Micro is a solid device and I haven't fell into a problem with it yet *knocks on wood*.
287_ 6	negative	The antivirus feature is phenomenal, and is regularly updated.
136_ 7	positive	This setup using the CD was about as easy as learning how to open a refrigerator door for the first time.
153_ 2	positive	The main advantage of this system over its predecessor is the ability to open a wider pipeline between clients.
209_ 18	neutral	Something about the pictures suggests a deck-of-cards size, but you can hide the Micro completely under a standard business card.
3_ 2	neutral	I take it with me everywhere,literally,
0_ 31	positive	The Canon is very small, definitely pocket size, but still easy to hold firmly.
28_ 3	neutral	I said, can your fancy camera do that?
209_ 2	neutral	Why, troubleshooting, mediating software conflicts, devising workarounds, and when things got too bizarre, even calling tech support.
136_ 33	neutral	Follow the directions exactly.
132_ 167	positive	Everything I Wanted! The Apple iPod has become one of the most sought-after electronic gadgets - and for good reason.
132_ 249	positive	 And, with the iPods' full volume up, all you have to do is adjust your receivers' volume and your set, since the iPod itself acts as a strong amplifer of its' own.
287_ 43	neutral	No longer.
206_ 2	neutral	Of all the players that I have owned in the past (6 of them), all of them have had drawbacks and problems.
233_ 43	neutral	gee anyways ENJOY WHAT WORKS!
124_ 3	neutral	The Hitachi, on the other hand has a beautiful large flat edge to run against a guide, and the sub-base is recessed so as not to interfere.
140_ 9	neutral	No hold time.
0_ 198	neutral	To limit lag time, turn off flash or if flash needed, turn off display.
178_ 5	neutral	Though admittedly I am a novice at networking, I am not an idiot and can read directions.
249_ 3	positive	I can use it as a modem for my computer, connect with clients and friends, the possibilities are endless.
291_ 6	negative	The customer support is pathetic.
132_ 52	neutral	This 20 gigabyte iPod by Apple Computer allows you to put up to 5000 songs onto it, in a choice of digital formats.  MP3, AAC, etc.
132_ 7	negative	 It has an equalizer, but the iRiver H10-20GB has a lot more presets than the iPod.
190_ 5	neutral	I decided to go with the convienence factor and purchase a creative zen micro.
132_ 429	positive	 Overall, this product is AWESOME.
151_ 8	positive	Overall, this router seems like a reasonably priced product th!
213_ 4	neutral	anyway, here's the pros and cons:  +linux compatible with the 1.x series of firmware.
217_ 16	neutral	I'm not professing to be a consumer-survey corporation, but I don't know *anyone* with an iTunes account.
79_ 26	positive	Let the Champ win you over!
87_ 1	positive	It works great.
256_ 8	neutral	Why have the function if you can't film anything longer than e few seconds?
166_ 58	neutral	My last topic concerns the security setup you do, or have done with your router.
186_ 14	positive	The package also comes with a USB cable, an AC adapter, a pair of headphones (they're okay until you get a better pair), a stand, and a microfiber pouch to carry your Zen Touch in.
233_ 0	neutral	Its been 11 months now that I've held on to my Nokia 6600 for.
132_ 492	neutral	 It's small and lightweight, but it has very little storage space and the shape is clunky.
132_ 182	positive	ITunes can be downloaded from the enclosed CD or for free from the Apple site.
299_ 7	neutral	It did find Outlook Express, but that's not what I use.
232_ 1	negative	3660 had similar features, but that is big in size.
240_ 10	positive	Few month ago, it's very popular among my community.
225_ 45	negative	because the "engineers" at Creative screwed up the design of the headphone jack.
178_ 16	neutral	Anyway, after learning that the "Speedboost" feature only does anything for you if (1) you are also using a Speedboost adapter (which I was), and (2) if you are transferring large data files between computers (Note: it does NOT increase your speed on the Internet, but only between computers on the network), I opted to return the product and get the standard Wireless G (v.5).
311_ 11	negative	I see many other reviews that say the same....stay away from Norton, they don't deserve you, or anyone!
0_ 61	positive	Audio is mono and fairly acceptable, quiet also with little distortions.
183_ 29	neutral	3.
183_ 40	negative	IRiver has a better FM receiver built in, but the drawback to IRiver products is they are flimsy and poorly constructed.
208_ 14	neutral	I haven't used the Organizer feature (apparantly you can sync with Outlook).
115_ 4	negative	Shortly after I brought it, the plunging shafts started sticking.
132_ 348	neutral	 I was shopping for a MP3 player recently, and had the opportunity to play with my cousin's 20GB iPod at some length to see how I liked it.
131_ 16	negative	The electronic speed control is not doing it's job and the router begins to speed up and slow down at will.
132_ 282	neutral	  THE PROS  The bad ends here, because as far as I'm concerned the rest of...well...everything concering the iPod is an enormous PLUS!
192_ 16	negative	- Not compatible with Audible.com books.
0_ 69	neutral	But if you want a pocket camera to use when you cant take your Digital SLR with you that will capture quality images this is your choice of camera.
124_ 4	positive	The power is incredible, it cut through MDF and plywood like butter.
0_ 189	neutral	For me the colors of the Casio-cameras (Z750, Z50)aren't by far as good as that of the SD500, the pictures looks more artificial and over processed.
32_ 16	neutral	Another is the ability to upload images from your PC to a memory  card in the camera.
113_ 5	positive	The handles make it very comfortable to use and I experience little vibration.
249_ 4	positive	The ringtones are beautiful, the screen is super high quality.
166_ 15	neutral	Of course your data, and installed programs are gone if you do that.
132_ 358	neutral	 I disagree.
228_ 0	neutral	Nobody has clearly articulated what exactly about the Ipod mini makes it better than this product.
29_ 3	positive	This is a great product, and Canon has done an excellent job.
225_ 31	neutral	Once I did this, visions of burning my CDs-literally-dance around my head, and all was right in the world (of course, I would have backed my files up, silly).
124_ 7	positive	I do not count this as a negative, however, because it is not that much of a nuisance and at the price for what you get this router is way too good to pass up!!!
242_ 43	positive	There are number of downloads needed/available for this phone & they will be texted to you at no cost.
243_ 38	neutral	The supervisor stated that it must have been third-party applications on the 6600 that caused the 3650 to break, and would not take the suggestion that his own tier-2 technicians stated that it was not possible to back up the 6600 to the 3650 without damaging the 3650, regardless of what was or was not on the 6600.
139_ 6	positive	I have had mine for about a year and use a third party firmware on mine and love it.
100_ 18	neutral	It takes all of 2 minutes, if that.  4.
312_ 2	neutral	It seems like Symantec did a lousy job on this version.
67_ 5	negative	But, sometimes, if the Champ is too full, the flip handle won't function.
302_ 1	neutral	Some of the options are confusing, especially when the popup warnings occur, but I've had no problems with intrusions.
307_ 10	neutral	And this despite the fact that I'm not even using AntiSpam.
132_ 293	neutral	 But really, EVERYONE I've seen with an iPod leaves them off.
132_ 365	neutral	 Since no company has yet to come out with an interchangeable battery for the jukebox-sized players (the Creative Labs Zen Micro is the only one I'm aware of that has this, and it's 5 GB), this can be an issue.
253_ 8	positive	In short, the Nokia 6600 is an evolution but not a revolution.
132_ 345	negative	However, in my mind, $299 is a lot to pay for a device that will only last 18 MONTHS.
251_ 8	negative	3- It is SLOW , if you keep the original configuration and progs (why'd u buy it then ?!) it'll run smoothly , but still slower than most other coloured-screen Nokias .
221_ 11	neutral	Apple has tried to hide something from you: most people don't actually need more than a few gigs at most.
166_ 34	neutral	With wireless routers, you have another potential hole, "the wireless connection".
132_ 329	neutral	 Organizing music is a breeze too.
207_ 16	neutral	My PC is running Windows 98 though....maybe having old outdated things is a good thing for once!
220_ 3	positive	The sound is bright and clear, the ability to store any MP3's (and not just Apple-approved files) is great, and I plan to make use of the storage space and sound recording from time to time.
100_ 3	positive	In fact, I liked it so much after using it with my son who is now 2 years old, that I bought one for our new baby's room.
256_ 16	neutral	But beware of the bugs; they are major!
318_ 3	positive	I upgraded from NIS 2003, and the change in performance has not been noticeable.
132_ 391	neutral	Fortunately his insurance covered it (also extraordinary), and as luck would have it, this new gen of iPods came out the same week he got the check.
306_ 15	negative	They didn't know what the problem could be.
132_ 389	neutral	 Actually I had two: the first one stopped working within a month so I took it back, and they exchanged it (which is evidently pretty extraordinary - guess I lucked out.  I didn't tell them I had dropped it once).
36_ 10	positive	4- Looks great.
285_ 0	positive	I'm not sure why all the bad reviews, my computer isn't especially slowed down and I have Win'98.
0_ 22	positive	They say that they are the best pictures they have ever see from a compact.
38_ 1	positive	This camera is great, wonderfully small, and has attactive hi-tech casing.
307_ 3	negative	You can "disable" some of the individual components, but don't be fooled--they're still there and running.
0_ 202	neutral	Check out the other professional reviews for this camera on the web.
80_ 4	positive	I use the regular kitchen trash bags and it is so easy to empty.
189_ 12	neutral	1.
132_ 191	neutral	 Wow... just less than 15 minutes and the back of it already has a scratch!
214_ 16	neutral	One was the firmware upgrading from the installation CD and the second was regarding the "playforsure" (even though it's in BETA), to make sure I could use Napster 2 Go.
132_ 405	neutral	But seriously though, how bout we work on the durability thing for the next gen.
15_ 8	negative	The digital zoom is crap.
281_ 3	neutral	I am thankful that I have Roxio GOBACK, I had to use it 3 of the 4 times.
1_ 4	negative	I have to move pictures off of it every day so I have room for more pictures the next, and I don't have enough money to buy the 256 MEG card that I've had my eye on for a while.
132_ 92	neutral	This is a great device, but there are its pros and cons.
147_ 4	negative	That is, you cannot access the internet at all.
100_ 11	positive	So much safer than the others that require a two handed operation!
76_ 2	neutral	I have heard that it will eventually become my sons favorite place to put his toys when he becomes a toddler, but I've got 2 years to worry about that and I'm sure I'll figure out preventative measures like any other mom.
174_ 17	neutral	Best practice is learn how to setup encryption.
142_ 6	neutral	After countless attempts at recycling the modem and WPA keys etc.
274_ 12	neutral	Looks big in the display ads though.
312_ 8	positive	I've tried the free versions of zone alarm and the free version of sygate and they both have a nice and easy installation and work great!.
132_ 392	neutral	  So I got a free 5G upgrade out of that misfortune.
125_ 8	positive	I've got a buddy who's trying to offload his almost new $300 Speedmatic because he saw what this router can do.
215_ 15	positive	BUY THE ZEN!"
132_ 77	neutral	Very Pleased.
132_ 110	neutral	Get an ARCHOS Gmini400 instead  If you are doing your research and thinking whether iPod is right for you...      give the ARCHOS Gmini400 a look.
229_ 13	positive	By far this seems to be the best value out there for the money; if you are undecided, the Creative Zen Micro seems to be the best choice.
166_ 21	neutral	Many if not most cable / DSL systems are looking for the Mac address!
317_ 0	neutral	While it has a rather effective firewall, and comes with Norton Antivirus (which I'm actually rather fond of), the Security Suite has significantly slowed down my system.
132_ 369	neutral	  This may be the player for you, but it's not leaps and bounds ahead of any other player, and others are ahead of it in certain areas, so practice some caution when you buy.
0_ 59	positive	I have especially enjoyed the 640x480 mode, while not a replacement for a dedicated video camera, its quality easily surpasses that of my old Hi-8 camera and is perfect for quick clips of things that still images just dont describe (max 8 mins at 640 30fps on a one gig card).
111_ 4	positive	UNLIKE other reviewers, I like the tool because it is easy to operate outside of the router table.
132_ 528	neutral	There's no two ways about it, I have been less than impressed with my own iPod 20 GB when it arrived two weeks ago.
324_ 14	negative	This time, it started the uninstallation process, then I left for work. I think it will work. I hope it will work.
31_ 8	negative	All that said, I am a little disappointed with the quality of the pictures from the camera.
0_ 124	neutral	In response to "testing" the LCD through pressure in the center and sides, I am glad that it did not cause any damage.
181_ 3	neutral	When most of us purchase these little devises, we do so because of their diminuitive size and extraordinary storage capacities.
157_ 3	positive	IF YOU NEED A WIRELESS ROUTER.... GET IT GET IT GET IT.... works really good....
140_ 8	neutral	A five minute call to the tech support people was all it took to get the router up and running.
32_ 10	positive	The two-times optical zoom operates smoothly  and quietly, and lo and behold, a two-piece shutter-like cap automatically  slides closed over the lens when you turn the camera off.
143_ 1	positive	It took me about an hour to set up a wireless environment in her townhouse and she hasn't called me yet with any problems.
207_ 7	negative	Well, I got my second player, and right out of the box it wasn't working right and once again, after consulting customer se!
98_ 2	neutral	I am wondering how some of these reviewers are able to stand having kids?
132_ 346	neutral	 Hence, the one star rating...
132_ 166	neutral	Buyer beware!
151_ 3	neutral	I had to change the channel of the router, like the channel on a cordless phone, to get it to work with the Linksys Instant USB Wireless Adapter v2.6.
163_ 10	neutral	Maybe you could consider the used WRT54G version 3.1 if you can find it?
131_ 9	negative	Luckily the soft start helped before it took the wood and tossed it or worse case, a finger.
213_ 29	positive	But since it's so small, it isn't a big deal to bring it with me.
36_ 6	neutral	Fool proof.
221_ 6	positive	unarguably better than Apple's, and nice earbuds to boot.
195_ 34	neutral	Instead I use a cellphone cover with a belt clip and it works just fine.
144_ 12	neutral	However, since it is not being able to perform its core function adequately, it doesn't deserve any higher.
132_ 248	neutral	 I actually hooked up the iPod to my receivers AUX port with a Pbus connector and a Y-splitter cable, it wasn't too hard to do and now, I can listen to all my music in my car without ever having to lug around CDs again.
32_ 19	neutral	As other reviews have noted, you will  definitely want one or more additional memory cards.
138_ 20	neutral	I would suggest for Linksys to include a hardcopy quickstart guide for those users with !
15_ 2	neutral	Here are some useful facts:-
221_ 7	neutral	Looks?
206_ 19	negative	While transferring songs to the player, the interface has crashed a few times (4-5 times in a 4-5 hour period) normally this would cause me major concern, but it appears that this bug is reproducible, which leads me to believe that Creative will fix it with a patched version shortly (or maybe it's just my computer).
290_ 9	positive	You won't need to update your firewall and antivirus separately or install two disks.
183_ 16	neutral	The company has received thousands of complaints about this and refuses to do anything about it. .
108_ 11	neutral	This entails wiping the rods, blowing compressed air into the housings, and lightly lubricating the rods with silicone lubricant.
227_ 15	neutral	However, once an album is playing, there's no gap between songs.
0_ 220	neutral	On the 60fps setting it seems like a regular video recorder!!
36_ 3	neutral	I've been taking near 100 pictures per month since I got mine.
149_ 4	neutral	I'm returning this, as I'm not willing to waste more time trying to contact tech support, particularly in light of the comments of other reviewers who have done so.
31_ 9	positive	They are razor sharp, the color balance is perfect, and the focus is great.
144_ 2	negative	The Achilles heel of this router is its inability to stream music, or copy large files over the local network.
233_ 18	positive	4. The Build is just right.
136_ 13	neutral	Within 10 minutes I was surfing the web from all over the house.
211_ 6	neutral	I've never owned an Ipod, so this won't be a which one is better review.
270_ 11	positive	It's a bit pricey to call home from other countries but the instant messaging to and from covered countries in Europe are quite reasonable.
1_ 0	positive	I want to start off saying that this camera is small for a reason.
173_ 7	negative	The downside being that the Tivo can only connect at 802.11b speeds and not 802.11g.
134_ 2	neutral	I know more about networking than 70% of the consumers out there, so I was able to puzzle my way through it, but only by second guessing the documentation at various stages.
112_ 0	neutral	My first experience with this router was when I was working in a professional window and door shop.
128_ 6	positive	It has plenty of power.
196_ 13	positive	Transferring files couldn't be easier thanks to the included software bundle.
132_ 526	neutral	Well reviewing a product like this is definitely complicated, because do I rate my personal connotation on it?
3_ 9	negative	This camera uses a lithium battery, I find lithium batteries to be highly inconvenient; because what if you are on vacation, where the nearest place to buy batteries is just a gas station--there is no way that you are going to find lithium batteries there.
0_ 215	neutral	Camera powers on and ready in about a second.
256_ 9	negative	I find this feature on this phone useless, but, since I don't really need this function anyway, I don't really use it.
127_ 2	positive	Cuts are easy and smooth.
225_ 43	negative	But, all of this means nothing, because of the serious, serious, stupid and ridiculously elemenatary design flaw: After 3 months, give or take a few weeks, you won't be able to hear anything.
0_ 147	positive	The instruction manuals and documentation are excellent so that the learning curve will be much less steep.
166_ 67	neutral	However many you open up, remember you are putting holes in your firewall, making your computer!
269_ 2	positive	you actually can talk to a real person for support in under an hour!).
105_ 3	neutral	Also stuck a couple of o-rings in the collet like a previous reviewer suggested & have never had a stuck bit.
93_ 9	positive	I also love that you can flip the device with one hand...
132_ 407	neutral	 The other thing is the earbuds.
178_ 22	positive	I still need to read up on some of the security settings, etc to fully understand all that's up there, but bottom-line is that the installation was like night and day compared to the Speedboost router.
0_ 175	positive	if you are looking for a small camera to throw in your pocket, take great pics and video, get the SD500.
287_ 1	negative	This product has virtually all the same installation problems.
132_ 402	neutral	 The thing is, naturally you're going to use your iPod at the gym or whatever, and it can be a bit of a liability because you always feel like you have to protect it.
211_ 3	neutral	It's been in my pocket, in my car, and in my bag in 20 inches of snow and 100 degree summers.
0_ 18	negative	Some more manual control would have been nice.
44_ 0	neutral	OK so I bookmarked pages about this camera on our home computer, in a place I was sure my wife would see, and loh and behold, what did I get.
205_ 18	positive	They also sound excellent compared to other earbuds including retail sets like Panasonics and Sennheisers.
249_ 8	negative	I can NOT find a carrier for this phone I like, end up just tossing it in my purse.
140_ 1	neutral	The tough part was deciding whether or not I needed the "Speedbooster" version.
178_ 23	neutral	The performance of the router itself deserves 5 stars, but the Linksys documentation and support is so poor that I can only give it 4.
274_ 16	neutral	So my review should defintely give you an idea about this phone.
77_ 0	positive	I think it's great.
221_ 3	neutral	Tall order, eh?
132_ 472	negative	This is only a problem at night, during the day the screen is very easy to see.
111_ 17	positive	For me, it is as important that the tool be comfortable to use as it is that it produce a high-quality result.
250_ 5	negative	This process can be very annoying and unsafe when you are driving a stick shift on the highway.
147_ 11	neutral	I have returned it and have a cheaper, nicer Belkin.
132_ 23	negative	 There is no photo viewing option, however, there is a 20 GB photo iPod, but it costs $20 more.
199_ 19	neutral	I say get one today!!
132_ 160	neutral	  It seems to deteriorate every time I use it.
127_ 11	positive	I really liked the price...
193_ 10	neutral	I also hated the packaging, with a passion.
31_ 5	positive	The software has been installed on Windows 95, 98, 2000 and XP and I haven't had any problems with it.
169_ 9	neutral	This is my first foray in!
281_ 1	neutral	I bought NIS 2004 recently to try it out.
100_ 13	positive	The Diaper Champ is so simple that my toddler loves to put his own diapers in the diaper champ and flip over the handle.
71_ 8	positive	But from my experience, by the time it gets to that point, the bag is really heavy, so I think this is kind of helpful- it's a built-in way of keeping the bag manageable upon emptying.
111_ 5	positive	Both the on/off switch (soft start) and the depth lock are within easy reach of the right hand.
9_ 1	positive	It's still one of the smallest 2MP digital cameras on the market, and absolutely one of the best-built most stylish cameras ever.
146_ 10	neutral	No more connection!
181_ 9	positive	The base was deeper and the highs were crisper.
232_ 7	positive	Goes ~3 days after a charge.
318_ 4	positive	On the contrary, I'm quite pleased with my upgrade.
150_ 4	neutral	If buying for home office or small business this is a must.
115_ 2	positive	I find that it is stable in my hands and its' weight actually contributes to that stability.
0_ 83	positive	digital zoom is clear too...say you used all 3x optical zoom, try to do digital zoom then...just try not to shake the camera at all and you'll still get a clear good quality picture
225_ 0	positive	The Creative Zen Micro, at first glance, is a dream come true for all mp3 and music lovers.
191_ 16	positive	The first thing I did was upgrade the firmware to the version required for WMP10, it syncs flawlessly with Media Player and transfers are fast.
134_ 8	neutral	provide no printed manual.
0_ 30	neutral	More detail. More natural color.
108_ 2	positive	I noticed that the micro adjustment knob and collet are well made and work well too.
221_ 18	positive	Flawless.
250_ 3	negative	This phone doesn't include Phone card calling.
166_ 12	neutral	They then send in Trojans, Worms, (programs that extract, and run themselves in your computer) plus other nasties, to steal information, or take control.
313_ 5	neutral	My computer configuration is probably all screwed up at this point.
132_ 524	neutral	That's a lot of money Apple are making from a very powerful, influential and trendy product.
176_ 9	positive	As far as Linksys goes, I have used several of their products and they seem to hold up well - no problems.
0_ 24	positive	 I went out and got the Canon today.
275_ 6	neutral	there are lengthy hacks offered requiring root access and edits via terminal.
212_ 10	positive	Pros The Design is very nice, and the colors are too.
183_ 5	neutral	I just tried to move a load of plain data files from my home computer to my office work computer, and it is promting me to install Zen Micro software, etc....
199_ 5	positive	Fortunately for me, I have yet to have a single problem with this player.
222_ 6	neutral	Mine came with a wall adapter, but it charges when plugged into the computer anyways.
104_ 1	positive	The Hitachi is made in Malasyia, and looked cheap compared with the Makita, which is made in the USA.
132_ 155	negative	 *The ipod is overly sensitive to just about everything and gets scratched easily.
202_ 1	negative	The colors are a joke, and I personally hate the stupid vertical touchpad.
0_ 214	neutral	Almost no lag between button activation and shutter.
202_ 2	negative	But my biggest gripe is still the extremely ugly design.
319_ 8	negative	There is absolutely nothing useful at the Symantec/Norton site.
321_ 4	neutral	For security buy Zone Alarm. It's a very friendly program.
127_ 4	negative	The major reasons I didn't give it a five are:  One, I didn't think the fine adjustment worked well.
132_ 519	neutral	You've earned a new fan.
90_ 1	negative	The only downside to this is that it can get pretty stinky long before the pail is full.
212_ 13	positive	The battery is also convenient, but could have been better, such as the Zen Touch's battery (but at least this one is removable).
134_ 10	neutral	Stupid me.
298_ 25	neutral	If we had been unable to obtain the Corporate edition, we would NOT have purchased another Norton 2004 or 2005 home version anything.
268_ 31	positive	All in all, this is a great phone.
132_ 152	neutral	buyers BEWARE!
253_ 0	positive	I use a Nokia 6600, it has a great color TFT display and camera equipped with zoom, which complement a built-in video recorder with audio and a RealOne player for playback and streaming of 3GPP-compatible and RealMedia video clips.
35_ 0	positive	I was looking for a compact, rugged (I carry it hiking, skiing, boating, etc) camera which is easy to use.
132_ 186	positive	All in all, this is a wonderful device.
25_ 2	positive	The software that comes with the Digital Elph is very nice and intuitive.
100_ 5	positive	Wow - was that disappointing and we didn't even have it 6 months before it broke.
100_ 17	neutral	To replace the bag simply open it up and feed the top of the bag through ring, fold it over the sides of the ring, and close.
209_ 26	neutral	3.
265_ 14	positive	And Bluetooth does not drain the battery as quick as I thought it would, I usually can go 1.5 days with Bluetooth on along with making calls before I need a full recharge.
187_ 23	positive	Creating and modifying playlists is easy and clean.
131_ 8	neutral	Then, without warning, it took off again.
25_ 0	positive	This is my second digital camera, but I'm much more impressed with the Canon S100 Digital Elph than I EVER was with my Kodak DC240.
260_ 1	positive	Great reception, visibility and interface (may be complicated by others).
34_ 2	neutral	What else can I say?
132_ 447	neutral	 I can take it to Work, School, and even listen to it at my computer.
240_ 6	negative	I must say, this one is quite slow to open an application.
263_ 13	negative	i would highly recommmend...... oh and i have owned this baby for like 6 months now
212_ 7	neutral	$190 or $200 or less would have been much more reasonable (price compareble to 20gb mp3 players).
101_ 0	positive	I purchased this router at a woodworking show after watching the CMT people using it to demo their bits and was impressed how it performed.
281_ 11	negative	Norton has been on a downhill slid recently with their products, but with this one, they have fallen off the cliff.
214_ 19	neutral	Napster 2 Go also allows members to view other members play lists in different genres, so if you are looking for lots of songs and you don't want to search for them endless, you can just grab them from other members play lists. !
306_ 10	neutral	After extensive researching on the Symantec site I broke down and called Symantec.
116_ 9	positive	Even with that, I highly recommend this router - outstanding performer.
266_ 3	positive	The games are decent, but u only get 2 to start off with.
89_ 3	positive	THIS PRODUCT IS A LIFESAVER!!
207_ 12	positive	ORIGINAL REVIEW December 2004 I'm sorry to read about other people having problems with their Zen Micro, but mine has worked great!
192_ 11	negative	I downloaded the new firmware which was supposed to take care of the problem, but it hasn't worked.
221_ 17	neutral	)  Compatibility?
166_ 39	neutral	Don't try to install this yourself unless you have some technical knowledge.
5_ 0	neutral	I have had this little gem for four months now.
120_ 0	positive	This is an excellent router for the price.
193_ 19	neutral	This is Creative's attempt to compete with the IPod mini.
172_ 3	positive	Feature wise, its a lot better than the dlink and netgear routers out there.
88_ 3	neutral	As the bag fills, you may need to flip twice to ensure that the weighted cylinder has completely pushed the diaper into the bag.
132_ 125	neutral	 So far, in the month that I have had it, I have had to take it in for service twice.
242_ 25	positive	Secondly, all info can be sent to a computer and w/o the hassle of USB wires.
304_ 8	negative	I already knew something was wrong, because much of the Spam I've seen in the past six months was from resellers of Norton products.
5_ 6	negative	I find it a bit difficult to manage the very tiny buttons and impossible to read the icons without my reading glasses on.
100_ 21	neutral	Remember, it does hold dirty diapers!
183_ 9	neutral	But Amazon won't allow me to reduce the number of stars once I have already established three two days ago.
241_ 3	neutral	The best features that I use most often are:
191_ 18	neutral	A must for me, the fact that you can carry extra batteries is a big bonus.
276_ 9	neutral	DaveC
132_ 308	neutral	  Cons of the 40 GB: Much more expensive just for some extra space and a docking station, both of which you don't really need.
132_ 142	neutral	 i've had a beastly experience from trying to buy an ipod from circuit city.
233_ 24	positive	I click pictures in JPG format and because the phone has a bluetooth device I find it extremely easy to transfer pics to my pc and forth.
172_ 0	positive	Purchased this router a few months back, NO PROBLEMS whatsoever.
275_ 11	neutral	i'd rather have a little more phone than the t610 offers.
213_ 2	neutral	I mainly only get to listen to music in my car, so it's an awesome replacement for a console full of the same ten cd's that have been in there for the last 8 months that i keep forgetting to replace.
266_ 7	positive	The battery on mine lasts 2 days if I don't play games that much, and it only takes 90 mins to charge from flat.
324_ 12	neutral	Meanwhile, the damn alert is still popping up every 20 seconds.
225_ 57	neutral	If only only it was that simple.
131_ 20	negative	If this machine just stops on you, unplug it quickly and get out of the way!
228_ 8	positive	The main issue now is that this new Zen Micro seems to be the best on the market at least temporarily.
168_ 3	neutral	I tried to set my IP address and subnet mask and who knows what else.
310_ 2	positive	Also, with one click you can help train your spam killer.
132_ 35	negative	 There technical service isn't helpful either; they just read what's on their website and charge you $50 (+ toll fees) to do it.
307_ 2	neutral	If you get NIS be sure you want ALL of them installed and running on your machine.
132_ 2	neutral	I'm still figuring out why.
287_ 22	negative	The next problem was that it didn't recognize all the installed components, so it would not update them, most notably and importantly, virus definitions.
100_ 6	positive	I bought the Diaper Champ and have been very happy for the following reasons.
190_ 17	neutral	They didn't really make any difference.
132_ 428	neutral	  Think about that if you are worried about battery life.
89_ 0	neutral	I originally put this item on my baby registry because friends of mine highly recommended the use of a diaper pail.
132_ 184	neutral	Because it is a hard drive, it has moving parts unlike other MP3 players, perhaps making it more prone to catastrophic damage.
188_ 6	negative	i dont especially like how music files are unstructured; basically they are just dumped into one folder with no organization, like you might have in windows explorer folders and subfolders.
224_ 4	negative	So I took out the battery and put it back in again, only to find that it would not work.
132_ 469	neutral	Match them pretty well to boot.
234_ 7	negative	I hope you have a magnifying glass, because the number displayed as well as most of the pop up options are tiny.
132_ 313	positive	  Overall the iPod really is an almost flawless beast. The capacity in the 20 GB is more than I think most people would ever need and, for the price, I highly recommend it.
5_ 3	neutral	I was looking for a blend of the two and so I bought this camera.
140_ 3	neutral	The out-of-the-box experience was a little frustrating.
132_ 72	neutral	 However, you should still buy an iPod!
132_ 27	negative	I'm probably the only person that dislikes the iTunes software.
206_ 3	neutral	Although some came close to perfection, none of them left me completely happy with their performance.
218_ 0	neutral	I already own the Creative Nomad Zen, the 30 gig version.
195_ 24	positive	Excellent sound I mean the player has juice.
15_ 15	neutral	The front even has a zipper for an extra battery and your wallet stuff.
117_ 1	neutral	For exclusive use in a double router table I have been building.
268_ 5	positive	If you are using Linux, and you want to use GPRS to connect to the net, I suggest this phone along with a Belkin USB Bluetooth adapter.
136_ 19	positive	This router works at 54Mbps that's megabyte not kilobyte.
112_ 6	positive	I use it in the table (never take the springs out - just attach the fine adjustment knob), in my woodrat and freehand and it works great in all circumstances.
234_ 3	negative	As a computer, or PDA its weak since the screen, while large by phone standards, is still tiny to really do anything on.
138_ 13	neutral	There was no obvious screen stating what should be done - the program simply said the router was secured.
214_ 20	positive	The sound is very nice.
93_ 11	neutral	Makes life easier and keeps baby's room smelling like baby, not dirty diapers!
233_ 8	neutral	I think the keypad on your cell phone is the most important thing for me as Im constantly sending messages , calling people and fiddling around with my phone.
65_ 4	positive	look at the size of it!
114_ 0	positive	I first used the router in the free hand mode and liked it a lot.
186_ 11	neutral	Pressed play and I was off.
13_ 3	negative	When the screen stops working, you're out of luck !
197_ 6	neutral	Having owned both the karma and other Creative Lab products (including Zen) I would have to say the Karma also sounds better.
151_ 4	neutral	I also had to do this with the old router.
114_ 8	negative	I did have to cut off the ears  that hold the  template guide in place so I could get those big panel raising bits in it.
169_ 15	neutral	Great items !
132_ 253	neutral	 I go everywhere with it, on campus, in the gym and at work too !
132_ 18	negative	 Also, not liking the gel case.
132_ 14	neutral	The iPod's battery, 1.5 years.
115_ 5	negative	After repeatly cleaning and recleaning, it still stuck after using it for a little while.
0_ 173	positive	The view finder shows crystal clear pictures that will look even better when you get them to the computer.
243_ 26	neutral	I could not get the 3650 working to even factory defaults, even after trying every reset code they could muster.
132_ 187	neutral	About 1/2 inch thick, with the face dimensions the size of a credit card, it can be slipped in a pocket or carried easily in the han!d.
33_ 1	negative	If you're looking for a digital camera to replace your big Nikon or Canon SLR, forget it - film is still king when exquisite detail and fine color rendition are critical.
0_ 56	positive	I have been very impressed with my purchase of the SD500 I bought it at the beginning of the month as the ultimate pocket camera and have shot 300 images so far with it.
79_ 6	neutral	You had to remove the entire lid and lay it on the floor (which led to my toddler running away with it which is gross) while trying to fit the bag correctly into the slot.
243_ 27	neutral	Nokia finally determined that my phone was in need of repair, but since it was out of warranty (it was made in May '03 and they would not take an eBay purchase as proof) they refused to fix the phone for less than $120!
132_ 213	neutral	  My earlier generation (15Gb) iPod lasted two years, shortened by my own inattention to the simple maintainence asked by Apple (go through at least one charging cycle per month, and don't store the iPod in a car on a summer day because high temp. is harmful to the battery's life).
79_ 17	neutral	The Champ gives you peace of mind and wallet.
190_ 0	neutral	I'm addicted to music.
173_ 0	neutral	I'm going to be moving soon.
266_ 1	negative	The video recorders a bit odd, sometimes I get 9 secs on my recordings, sometimes I get 17.
225_ 1	neutral	I absolutely didn't want to by an Ipod.
264_ 2	neutral	Menu is a bit slow, but overall, phone is very functional.
178_ 7	neutral	The documentation was just horrible.
147_ 3	negative	A couple of times a week it seems to cease access to the internet.
122_ 0	neutral	At the last Anahiem WW Show I decided to get the M12V.
0_ 131	neutral	All were generally favorable but i still had my doubts just because their review is based largely on the kind of photography that they do.
135_ 10	neutral	) After messing about a bit with the CD, I went online to the Linksys site to look for support tips.
195_ 16	neutral	If one battery drains just snap the spare one and you are back in bussiness.
132_ 83	positive	 The sound is just fine.
233_ 20	positive	I've dropped it atleast a dozen times to my recolletion and it still works as good as ever.
147_ 6	neutral	Just no internet.
186_ 6	neutral	I ordered from Amazon and got the Limited Edition package that includes a free battery!
47_ 1	neutral	The Canon S100 destroys this problem.
221_ 0	neutral	If you're considering an iPod mini or even an iPod, read this.
228_ 11	neutral	It may be that the next Creative product is complete junk, but you should make product decisions based on product attributes NOW, not based on a halo effect of an idealized company (Apple) or other pointless loyalties.
223_ 15	negative	The headphones which came with it are mediocre at best but what can you expect from a set of "ear buds".
132_ 221	positive	Finally, compare the iPod to other players on a cost/Gb, and also consider ease of use.
117_ 0	positive	I purchased two of these beauties.
0_ 162	positive	The SD500 software install was seamless and the product documentation is very detailed.
225_ 40	neutral	It cost less than, in most cases, $190.
178_ 11	neutral	ter finds the router anyway, but it's unsecured.
28_ 1	neutral	One of my friends was going on and on about his camera and how fancy it was.
85_ 2	positive	Not only is it much more cost effective (you can use regular trash bags rather than Refills at $5 a pop), it is easier to use and clean, and has a larger capacity.
169_ 8	positive	The setup software did everything.
98_ 0	neutral	So far so good.
163_ 9	neutral	uter like the Buffalo WZR-RS-G54 with 64 megabytes of RAM and 8 MB flash (plus an amazing built-in PPTP VPN server that supports client-to-LAN as well as LAN-to-LAN connections).
78_ 2	neutral	Bottom line if you buy this for your newborn, it is fine.
251_ 9	neutral	As soon as you copy video/audio files and add some programs and games , it WILL hang at least 5-10 times a day.
187_ 14	positive	It feels solid and not flimsy like the carbon.
152_ 2	positive	Compatability with other devices is excellent too; I've only found one 11b device that won't work with its mixed mode (and it won't work with *anyone's* mixed mode).
132_ 399	neutral	 Needless to say, these are fragile machines.
191_ 9	positive	What I like the most:  - Small and solid feel.
307_ 7	neutral	Just to try to shut it up, I told it to go ahead and turn on COM automation.
216_ 5	negative	Also note that it doesn't seem to charge when connected to the PC, only when plugged into an AC socket even though they both connect to the single USB port on the player, so you have to charge the battery separately from downloading music.
0_ 64	neutral	If you use the LCD wisely and dont use it as a TV screen to show all your buddys the girl you went on a date with last night, you should be able to get plenty of shots in on a charge, I have only seen the warning light once, and that was after a week of daily occasional to medium duty use.
191_ 22	neutral	- Doubles as a removable disk drive.
199_ 12	negative	While the software may not be as easy as I-Tunes, it is not difficult to use by any stretch.
209_ 15	neutral	64 kbps is a terrible price to pay.
173_ 1	neutral	One device, Tivo Series 1 DVR, is far enough away from my network router to need either a really long Ethernet cable, or a wireless connection.
242_ 8	negative	No matter how accustomed to the phone you become, too much time is required to get to, open and close applications.
225_ 49	negative	Again, the headphone jack on this thing is garbage.
206_ 8	neutral	Slow file transfers, menus that take ages to cycle through, and poor battery life plague many of the!
132_ 252	neutral	Regardless though, it did set me back financially but now, I'm glad I have one.
114_ 5	neutral	I prefer to use my mind  to figure out how I'm going to build something not how my tools work.
0_ 219	positive	And the video quality is amazing.
132_ 190	negative	Holy cow! It really does scratch easily!
201_ 18	neutral	I actually prefer the vertical strip rather than running my thumb in continuous circular motion.
298_ 3	negative	We constantly got "Windows Virtual Memory Low" error messages popping up follwed by ridiculous slowdowns and/or crashes.
275_ 1	neutral	all the other features are gravy.
206_ 20	negative	Another thing I don't like is that some of the features take 1-2 seconds to load up.
129_ 8	neutral	I didn't use the speed control that often so that is not a big deal.
132_ 129	neutral	 To be sure, I am not looking forwards to paying for the battery replacement, whenever that may come.
166_ 59	neutral	Remember, you are working with two sets of security hardware boxes, your computer, and now your router.
225_ 56	neutral	You once had a cheap CD player (or walkman) that had the same problem, and you just used miniture screwdrivers to push the left/right prongs out.
196_ 8	neutral	The result, while naturally encompassing the acquisition of greater market share, is a mediocre product that stands out sorely in terms of quality and value when compared in a virtual vacuum to its competitors.
132_ 111	neutral	I returned my 20G iPod 7 months ago and got a Gmini instead.
107_ 8	positive	The height adjustment knob is a bit flimsy, but it works well and provides good accuracy.
43_ 3	negative	Sometimes the pictures are onthe dark side, but I'm able to fix that using the Photoshop 6.0 "adjust levels" function ... not sure how a person would do that without Photoshop, though.
134_ 9	neutral	I had downloaded the 112 page manual from the Linksys Website.
192_ 8	neutral	I get occasional hiss while driving.
285_ 5	neutral	This is pretty standard for an up to date computer anymore, so what's the fuss?
190_ 6	neutral	I was at [random electronic store], browsing through players, and came across two that made the cut.
195_ 25	neutral	I dont use the headphones that come with it instead I use Bose Triport headphones.
297_ 1	negative	There is little meaningful difference between the two versions aside from the tedius activation process, and the product is currently rather buggy and has problems running unless cleanly installed on a formatted drive.
70_ 2	positive	It's easy to use (just a flip of the lid, and the diaper is gone!).
111_ 15	neutral	Have read this on the web and can second the comparative preference.
144_ 9	positive	In addition it is very easy to setup.
267_ 10	positive	As for bluetooth, no problems at all.
324_ 10	neutral	On my own home computer.
136_ 9	neutral	ell you to shut off, and turning on what and when they tell you to turn things on, resulted in a delightful install.
241_ 12	positive	5) Bluetooth wireless technology, so that I can transfer data to and from my computer without messing with any cables.
132_ 512	neutral	 The only other problem I have noticed is that on some uploads it will switch around CD song titles (all on the same artist, it just mixes up the titles).
179_ 2	neutral	I would never get 108M rate unless I was half a meter from the box.
146_ 1	neutral	Ended up returning to a Linksys router and giving the cheap router the boot.
94_ 3	positive	A wise investment for the pocketbook & for the nose!!!
277_ 1	positive	Picture and video quality is ok.
255_ 9	positive	I think the interface is great.
58_ 8	neutral	I just know it really worked for us.
131_ 12	negative	Once a depth is locked, it will jump off a little while working.
242_ 19	negative	It's not as stylized as a Sony or Samsung.
132_ 516	neutral	 This is the first line of Apple products I have owned (we also have an iPod mini and are about to purchase a shuffle).
193_ 51	positive	The Zen lives up to the audio quality I love and expect.
127_ 1	positive	It doesn't bog down under load.
187_ 1	neutral	I use it on an average 5 hours a day I hook it up to my Belkin FM transmitter in the car or to my Logitech 2.
248_ 0	neutral	I have purchased two of these phones together from the Amazon market place.
75_ 0	positive	The diaper champ turns the smelly diaper into "what diaper smell" in less time than that.
233_ 12	positive	I must admit its not the best looking phone ever but then it has this look of static and absolute conviction that looks like everything a phone should be
253_ 5	positive	The Nokia 6600 is a decent extension of the smartphone line.
241_ 1	positive	While this phone obviously doesn't have the same quality construction as Motorola does, the Nokia 6600 is one of the better phones I've used.
73_ 0	positive	and we still LOVE it!
321_ 0	neutral	I ain't no computer geek, but I can wrestle with the best of them.
233_ 38	neutral	Overall I dont think I will ever upgrade from this phone.
213_ 13	negative	It DOES take some getting used to.
176_ 4	positive	Speed is not a problem.
307_ 9	negative	But those 2 come up every time.
39_ 0	positive	The controls are easy to understand and big enough that they are easy to see and use.
132_ 284	positive	 The battery life lastes 12 hours, and charges quickly. (As mentioned above, the initial charge is a minimum of only two hours - not too long at all!) Once you've downloaded your music, you can access the tracks by artist, genre, album, composer (this comes in handy when the actual composer is different from the artist - e.g. covers of songs), etc.
126_ 4	positive	I'll be getting a second one for my router table!
203_ 5	negative	Apple stil does it better but needs to come out with a 5 gig mini.
4_ 1	positive	after considering my needs further and researching the marketplace, I decided on the s100.
100_ 23	neutral	Now when you flip the handle you get the Stick Up smell instead.
183_ 31	negative	The box included a little polyester, pull-string BAG, (yes, you read right a BAG, something a boy would carry ten marbles in) and tries to pass it off as the case.
199_ 9	neutral	One reviewer made what *I thought* was a good point about the volume not having an independant control and being buried in a menu, but must not have spent very long with the player because if you slide your finger up or down the center touch button during a song, the volume goes up or down accordingly.
242_ 22	positive	Solid, squeak-free, large screen.
132_ 104	negative	 No Memory Stick slots-- Although a rare feature, it would be nice to have extra storage, not that it needs it Built-in Lithium Battery-- A huge hassle to bring this back; draining the battery once you get it helps, but removable/replaceable ones are a lot more convenient
320_ 2	neutral	Then I disabled both Norton Antivirus and Norton Internet Security.
132_ 322	neutral	 The ipod itself is very pleasing to hold with its smooth surfaces.
58_ 6	neutral	Here's the catch for us- our daughter never drank formula, which is what gives baby waste a foul smell, and when she was eating solids we followed the American Pediatric Association recommendation to flush solid products instead of disposing of them.
36_ 5	positive	2- Excellent picture quality and so simple to use!!!
67_ 4	neutral	Diaper falls into bag inside the Champ.
132_ 223	positive	This is the best purchase I've made in a very long time.
70_ 5	positive	And best of all, no wasting money on special refill bags---this takes ordinary garbage bags!
242_ 13	neutral	I'm not sure that a phone w/ these and all of the above features exists just yet. ...I'm not sure I'd want to spend THAT much time w/ a device, anyhow.
203_ 2	neutral	Looks nice but the conrols are awkward and the entire front is touch sensitive.
315_ 2	positive	I work on word, explorer, netscape, acrobat reader, photoshop at same time (meaning using a lot of memory), but still dont see a problem with computer (getting slow or crashing).
132_ 36	neutral	At least Creative and iRiver's only charge toll fees like most companies.
221_ 4	positive	Actually, the Creative Zen Micro solves all that.
101_ 6	neutral	I never could get the panel bit to fit right.
212_ 9	neutral	e again.
0_ 197	neutral	Get the Ultra SD card which allows very quick turnaround on shots.
132_ 197	positive	  Apple has definately fulfilled its reputation in making quality equipment, and surprisingly wasn't as expensive as its reputation normally holds.
82_ 2	neutral	It is also to wipe clean if you do get the chute a bit dirty.
211_ 25	positive	It gives you the most bang for your buck, period.
166_ 74	neutral	Let's put it this way, it's a big badge of honor in the hacking world if they can beat AOL, Microsoft, Earthlink, or another popular sites that provides Internet security.
132_ 263	neutral	You can transfer music from one PC to the other.
213_ 5	positive	the program is called Gnomad and works great for me and seems to cover all the features the included windows sofware does.
311_ 14	positive	It's a highly rated, KICK ASS firewall program that's bundled with the venerable Norton AntiVirus, plus extras (like Norton AntiSpam & Norton Parental Control) that make this security suite a must-have for people who have broadband internet access.
132_ 291	neutral	First of all, no one does this and it will make you stand out and look "uncool."
154_ 9	positive	The documentation is much better than the documentation that came with the 11b router -- I needed a lot of help from Linksys technical assistance to set that one up.
267_ 12	positive	Very simple and painless.
132_ 123	neutral	Still not so sure about this one...
132_ 354	neutral	While they have released those "tattoos" for the players, I think those just look cheap and gaudy, especially since they leave the corners of the iPod exposed.
195_ 23	positive	Sound: This is where I love Zen the most.
132_ 511	neutral	  It's very fast and easy to create custom playlists for upload.
211_ 2	neutral	I've owned this player for nine months now and it's been on 5 cross country trips, one trans-atlantic honeymoon, and numerous roadtrips.
132_ 457	neutral	Does not come with the dock, remote control, or carrying case like the 3rd generation units - but you get $100 off the price, so you can still end up with the same accessories, and a new generation iPod for the same money.
30_ 2	positive	I give this product five stars for its usability,performance, expandability, and definitely looks!
103_ 0	neutral	I have a small fixed base, single speed router that I use freehand.
311_ 10	negative	No problems now, just a sickly disappointment in the way Norton has abandoned thier customers.
132_ 385	neutral	 Quite simply, BUY THE IPOD, whatever size you wish.
320_ 5	neutral	After that was complete, I deleted the Norton Antivirus and Norton Internet Security folders left in the "Programs" section of Windows XP.
307_ 11	negative	Next, the big reason not to buy ANY Norton product:  If there's a problem with it, Norton charges $30 to even tell them about it.
131_ 3	neutral	First, I must say that I am a professional woodworker, so, this router was used every day.
287_ 20	negative	First, it failed whenever connecting to get updates.
24_ 0	neutral	My last digital camera was the Canon Powershot A5 Zoom, which I liked  quite a bit.
195_ 19	neutral	Dont have to switch to another device for FM tuner.
132_ 413	neutral	  Mac has at least cornered the mp3 player market across the board.
198_ 5	neutral	I'm less than satisfied.
256_ 0	neutral	I bought this phone after having other phones that had less-than-consistant reception.
128_ 11	negative	I am seriously considering purchasing another wrench and just not using the "sliding wrench" which comes on the router.
243_ 8	neutral	Since I use my Palm PDA and T-Mobile offers unlimited Internet, I asked the sales representative if I could use this phone as a Bluetooth modem for my Palm, and he said yes.
298_ 23	positive	 I've used the Corporate edition at work without any problems ever.
74_ 3	positive	It works with a minimum of fuss.
187_ 6	positive	It feels tiny in the hand without it.
146_ 6	neutral	You won't regret it.
222_ 1	positive	This player is absolutely phenomenal, I haven't had any problems, and if you're worried you will have problems, I suggest buying it at a retail store that has a good return policy but anyways... I find the touch pad very easy to use, and I'm surprised so many people have had problems.
241_ 6	neutral	2) Camera phone.
0_ 21	neutral	I have showed the pictures I have taken to many of my colleagues, alot of whom have expensive dslrs.
17_ 4	positive	But it takes gorgeous pictures for a 2.1 MP camera.
268_ 13	positive	The phone can use any MIDI audio file as a ringtone.
132_ 44	neutral	It holds a ton of songs and looks cool in the palm of your hand.
270_ 8	negative	They really are awfully small.
0_ 153	positive	another thing i like about this camera is the way that you can swap colors around and the impressive video quality i would advise any person in the market for a camera to pay the little extra on the hefty $500 price tag and get a quality camera.
175_ 11	positive	So the pretty solid router all around good for the money  here's the link to firmware updates http://www.sveasoft.com/forum6.html
204_ 6	positive	It looks nice and sleek and the blue background light looks awesome against the black.
132_ 356	neutral	  While he's not the most careful guy in the world, it was really beat up consider the minimal amount he uses the thing, and talking to other people who have iPods confirmed that the player scratches very easily- and from personal experience, they look terrible scratched up.
132_ 54	neutral	iTunes is a great piece of software, and you can also buy songs from the iTunes Store at 99 cents per download.
132_ 383	positive	For looks, well iPod is head and shoulders better, both the iRiver and Creative Zen look positively ugly when next to a gleaming iPod.
320_ 9	positive	So far, the Anti-Spam feature seems to be very good.
5_ 2	neutral	I had a regular Canon Elph (APS), as well as a JVC digital camera.
152_ 0	neutral	Now that the 11g spec is final, and a new firmware has been released supporting it, the WRT54G is a serious contender for your wireless network.
166_ 73	neutral	Often they restrict you from sites you want to visit, and you can still be reached by clever hackers who con you into opening or using their files or programs.
0_ 79	neutral	totally love this feature...very useful since i love taking pics of my 7-month old baby =)
132_ 205	neutral	 This has been the case with all other competing music services and Napster.
67_ 8	neutral	Bag the diaper in this small clean-smelling bag and then chuck it in the Champ.
0_ 27	neutral	The quality, detail and clarity is much better than the Sony in my opinion.
111_ 7	neutral	I use custom side clamps set up for 1/4 and 1/2 inch bits in order to plough mortises easily (and with great accuracy).
80_ 0	neutral	My biggest concern was would this truly control the odor and yes it did.
237_ 2	neutral	Ha!
36_ 12	positive	5- Excelent software package.
215_ 6	positive	I think sound quality should be the first and foremost feature, and the Zen is leaps and bounds better in sound quality, with no need to upgrade the earphones.
132_ 60	neutral	It is best to protect the iPod in a case of some kind.
205_ 17	positive	So far it has been very durable (other than the little pads on the earbuds), but those aren't really necessary as I find them comfortable on their own.
151_ 7	neutral	Granted, I am a professional technologist with years of experience.
298_ 20	neutral	So, we're fed up.
132_ 59	negative	 The back of the iPod is in a chrome finish, and this surface is prone to scratches.
209_ 22	neutral	unboxed and charging up, visit the Creative website for necessary firmware and/or driver upgrades, especially if you're planning to use a service like Napster.
62_ 0	negative	My main complaints are that it should be deeper or wider as it doesn't even fit a smaller sized garbage bag.
243_ 39	negative	In short - Nokia themselves don't know that this phone doesn't work with the Palm, and if you don't heed my advice you will spend hours with technicians around the globe reading from scripts, chiding you in broken english for not following their directions exactly.
246_ 6	positive	The plusses are the features, look, good signal and battery life, memory size and robustness.
190_ 20	positive	However, if there was one thing I liked about the creative, it would be the car adapter.
137_ 0	negative	I had some issues when I had enabled WEP encryption and then moved on to WPA.
0_ 184	positive	Could be better to be a perfect camera (and some competitors do some of this better): purple fringing, details in high-light area, noise over ISO100, red-eyes, (few)processing artefacts, (few)loss of some details especially of the hairs of peoples in low light, automatic autofocus, whizing while video-playback, better video comression (smaler viedo-files), more manual controls, longer lasting battery, indicator for battery, better protection of the LCD, less weight.
132_ 147	neutral	 i called circuit city and complained that they had sent me an already opened box.
183_ 13	neutral	Read the next six mixed pros and cons: .
193_ 16	neutral	Upon logging in I received a notification that my player works with Napster but not Napster To Go.
272_ 1	positive	I can connect to my computer via bluetooth to transfer images, calender events, contacts and anything else.
79_ 13	neutral	You can save your bags from your shopping trip and insert them into the Champ.
182_ 2	neutral	i got 6000 mp3's you'll never register or gay up.
265_ 4	negative	I saw a few complaints on the load time of menus and I feel people are over-exaggerating the menu load time.
117_ 11	neutral	As I find it inheritly inaccurate by design.
221_ 14	neutral	)  Construction?
233_ 10	neutral	2. The looks are absolutely no nonsensical.
171_ 1	negative	Both of them keep disconnecting on me and interruptions are 3 or 4 times per day at best.
132_ 108	neutral	  A lot of people go for the iPod because of its reputation, but if you honestly shop around and check out the reviews on Cnet and things like that, you can find a better 20GB HD MP3 player.
250_ 10	neutral	All I need to do is to choose the contact and in option select "calling card call".
192_ 5	positive	- Looks sleek, compact, has a radio.
146_ 13	positive	Even though you could get a cheap router these days, I'm happy I spent a little extra for the Linksys.
265_ 3	positive	The interface is simple to use.
0_ 72	neutral	I can accept a little purple fringing on the ocassional difficult shot.
193_ 48	positive	What impressed me most was the sound.
246_ 4	negative	Secondly, in addition to the lag each time you give a command, it's just not that easily useable on the go.
298_ 28	negative	Our Norton Internet/AV 2004 was terrible right from the get go, so I'd think that if SytemWorks is ok now, it should remain ok.
208_ 16	positive	Overall, I am very pleased with it.
207_ 27	neutral	Those are minor complaints though.
204_ 0	positive	This product is amazing and better than the Ipod you can get at the same price.
0_ 137	neutral	So i figured i would "compromise" and get the camera that i could, and would, take everywhere.
51_ 2	neutral	You can take it anywhere withyou, unlike other bulky cameras, and capture every moment of yourlife.
220_ 16	positive	As I said, I don't regret the purchase at all.
46_ 1	neutral	An Olympus 2500 and an Olympus 620.
147_ 10	neutral	My mistake.
322_ 6	neutral	So when I reformatted for the third time, downloading SP2 took no time at all and the new XP was kind enough to even suggest other antivirus programs to try (it also listed Norton and McAffee).
137_ 2	positive	Even during the firmware updates my roommates did not loose wireless connectivity.
132_ 93	positive	 Pros: Large Hard Drive for the $$-- 20GB and 40GB are both affordable.
0_ 53	positive	Camera is a paper weight.
0_ 37	neutral	A few of my indoor shots could have benefited from a stronger flash, but even those shots were not all that bad.
56_ 0	positive	It's far better than all others on the market.
196_ 4	neutral	_  About the hype:  I must applaud Creative for their restraint.
133_ 2	positive	By no means do you have to be a tech junkie to be able to install it, just be able to put a CD in the computer and it tells you what to do.
96_ 2	positive	Also, it takes any kitchen sized trash bag, so there is no special bag to stock.
132_ 484	neutral	 After about 3-4 months, you see your battery draining faster than it should.
273_ 0	neutral	Hand set is good, but be aware of this T-MOBILE rebate.
143_ 6	neutral	I'd also recommend wireless products made by Belkin.
132_ 220	neutral	 In fact you may get a newer-better-cheaper device before you get to that point.
225_ 44	neutral	Why?
132_ 242	positive	(It sure does look nice, though!)  I recommend this to any music lover anywhere: the quality of the audio is excellent, the controls and indicators rapidly become intuitive, and the storage capacity and battery life are huge!
132_ 181	neutral	 PC users must have a processor of 500 MHZ or faster, Windows 2000 with Service Pack 4 or later or Windows XP, with the ports either built-in or expanded with a card.
211_ 13	neutral	It's doesn't have a scroll wheel, but it has a strip!
306_ 3	neutral	There was a Verisign problem that conflicted w/Word and Excel and was posted on the Symantec site that affected computers.
132_ 202	neutral	 This type of service is one that Microsoft is touting...  one where you pay a flat rate per month for unlimited music downloads.
233_ 32	positive	The handsfree provided by the phone is useful for those who talk on the phone while driving.
0_ 12	neutral	The camera was sitting on my home desk waiting for the new digital card and the weekend for the first round of serious shooting.
217_ 12	neutral	The iPod gets it right, the Carbon doesn't.
35_ 5	positive	The metal housing seems very rugged.
81_ 5	neutral	This eventually ruined the foam pad that is applied to the flip top to keep odors in.
132_ 326	neutral	  I have almost dropped the ipod several times, just because it is so smooth.
132_ 266	neutral	 If you plug your iPod into a PC and try to upload music/etc. it won't work.
132_ 95	positive	Decent Battery-- On the average size, but the 40GB comes with a dock.
134_ 5	neutral	After asking for a password (Is it asking me to set a password or am I supposed to know from page 20 of the manual that the factory set password is "admin"?) it refused to go past step 8.
0_ 49	negative	After 57 pictures total the LCD went black except for the icons showing the settings.
23_ 0	neutral	Good quality and fun!
174_ 1	neutral	And provides near zero-statistics.
189_ 25	neutral	3.
225_ 2	neutral	Not because I wanted to go against the grain, but the idea of having to shell out another 100 bucks (after a year) in order to have Apple replace the non-removable battery just turned me off.
302_ 0	positive	I've been using NIS 2004 for about 2 months and it works well.
209_ 21	neutral	To minimize any frustration (and the odds that you may return a usable unit), keep the following in mind:  1. While your unit is!
312_ 4	negative	To install that version you have to uninstall from the window registery anything called Symantec or Nortron,... also from the common files in the program folder the symantec folder has to be deleted.

255_ 13	positive	If I had to do it over, I wouldn't buy anything else.
129_ 2	neutral	Most of the time I use it mounted in a table, but obviously I also used it for hand held work.
94_ 2	positive	I am soooo pleased with this product!!!
174_ 13	neutral	MAC filtering stops visitors from using your network but they can still spy on your traffic.

188_ 9	positive	the sound is quite good, in terms of volume.
149_ 1	negative	The installation software CD crashed repeatedly.
324_ 3	negative	Multiple users on one machine never seemed to behave like you'd expect.

225_ 37	neutral	It's smaller, in most cases than the palm of your hand, and is ergonomically curved.
176_ 0	positive	Absolutely no problems with this router.
15_ 1	neutral	I have 2 batteries and a 128 mb card.
0_ 116	neutral	As much as I am happy about this great little camera, it is overshadowed by the fact that the LCD is easily spoilt.
31_ 0	neutral	I've had this camera for three years.
220_ 14	negative	Still, that's enough time that I'm still satisfied, if a bit grouchy with Creative's overhyped promises.
111_ 10	negative	1. Your Hitachi might come to you with a stiff spring mechanism.
211_ 8	neutral	So starting out i knew i wanted a windows friendly player.
66_ 8	neutral	I haven't noticed any seepage of smells.
5_ 15	neutral	I have found it gets less warm with the LCD off.
143_ 7	neutral	i've had their wireless card for my laptop since 2000 and it has rarely given me problems.
290_ 10	positive	The best part of the firewall is the visual backtracking.
153_ 0	positive	Setup in XP was instant and intuitive.
132_ 309	neutral	 Think about it for a minute - the 20 GB holds 5,000 songs: more than you're ever likely to need at any one time.
220_ 2	positive	On the whole, I'm quite happy with the purchase.
138_ 19	neutral	But if you did not know what to do, you might have to call Linksys.
225_ 59	neutral	You can't see it by looking into the jacks where the prongs are.

54_ 5	neutral	As she entered into toddlerhood we started having some bad diapers just becasue of her cutting teeth and diet changes.
208_ 5	neutral	The removable disk isn't really explained in the product literature but basically it allows you to partition a portion of the drive for data.
79_ 21	neutral	If you have only one child the Champ may last you until the child is out of diapers.
132_ 106	negative	No inbox accessories-- An arm strap, belt strap, case, or anything would be nice, but nope... Moveable parts-- This makes me almost want to keep my 3rd gen over a 4th; with moveable parts, its easy to damage an iPod at a gym, so this is for more casual listeners; note the iPod Mini doesn't have moveable parts and is made of titanium.
88_ 4	neutral	For the first 9 months or so, we only needed to empty this once a week.
274_ 13	negative	4) Buttons are quite small and is really a pain exp if one is fond of text messaging.
251_ 2	neutral	the difference is : until recently there have been no GSM networks in a wide scale , so most cell network companies supplied consumers with cells , we in the middle east (for example) have stopped using years ago ....
132_ 449	neutral	I hope you enjoy your I-Pod!
298_ 30	neutral	WRONG - SEE MY UPDATE ABOVE.
297_ 3	neutral	It included popup and ad blockers, referrer blockers, firewall,  intrusion detection, and all the same things that the 2004 version includes that are really needed.
32_ 7	positive	Second, it is  incredibly easy to use.
132_ 9	negative	  DURABILITY: Not good. First problem, if you haven't seen the news recently, the iPods are being recalled for battery problems and not lasting the advertised 18 months.
309_ 1	negative	When I purchase software, I NEVER want to have to spend hours looking up solutions to my install problems -- in particular solutions that involve manually setting driver preferences or editing the registry!
276_ 1	positive	It is a multifunction phone, reception quality is better than the 610.
65_ 3	positive	It also holds a lot more diapers.
3_ 10	negative	Not only is it inconvenient, but also the battery life span is short.
273_ 4	negative	Dont rely on T-Mobile rebates.
131_ 15	negative	Well, my second one is now beginning to hicup a bit after about 1 1/2 years.
48_ 0	neutral	Positives:
135_ 17	neutral	The router comes with a TON of options for setup, but sadly enough, I had no idea what most of it meant.
138_ 14	neutral	If I did not know what to do, I'd have no idea how to connect wirelessly.
232_ 5	positive	I have set up it's PDA features with avantgo.com where you can download info from sites like weather,mapquest maps/directions into it, which is great.
132_ 130	neutral	But enought of the negativity.
189_ 34	positive	I have no problem using iTunes with the Zen Micro (in a makeshift sorta way).

225_ 66	neutral	Do your research; check !
0_ 120	neutral	I would not deny that some cameras are not treated with care.
217_ 3	neutral	The latest craze for MP3 manufacturers is the 5Gb microdrive, a 25% boost from the 4Gb ones supplied by Hitachi.
132_ 503	neutral	A lot of this has to do with being so excited when you first get it that you get beside yourself and have to force yourself to slow down.  ;)  I love the shuffle function, which virtually eliminates the need to touch it at all.
25_ 5	neutral	I'd suggest that you not only buy this camera, but the case for it and an extra battery pack.
101_ 2	negative	The adjustment knob seemed ok, but when lowering the router, I have to practically pull it down while turning the knob.
322_ 9	negative	And I can't warn you enough to STAY AWAY FROM NORTON!!
174_ 10	neutral	When your laptop come home it must have a profile with the SID.
191_ 5	positive	It's being used daily and I have had none of the problems reported by other reviewers (headphone jack, player locking up, etc).

299_ 11	negative	After a recent update, I can no longer open more then 1 browser window.
89_ 10	neutral	For those who complain that the pail gets stuck, that is probably a good indication that the BAG IS GETTING TOO FULL!!
215_ 14	positive	This is really a no brainer.
233_ 37	negative	You can upgrade but then there's a certain level of trouble involved.
193_ 42	neutral	I sync the player with Napster software and it downloaded the library I had already created.
0_ 193	positive	Good color and very little needed to correct photos on Paintshop Pro.
132_ 11	neutral	iRiver's battery lasts four to five years.
94_ 1	neutral	I used it in conjunction with Glad 3ply kitchen trash bags with odor control (scented).
287_ 11	negative	The biggest problem is the installation.
195_ 33	negative	I dont use the belt clip cuz it fails to hold the player securely (design problem).
242_ 18	neutral	Few will look at the phone and know it's 'all that'.
136_ 30	positive	Installation was as near automatic as can be.
137_ 1	neutral	Ironically, the latest firmware update addresses this very specific issue.... so now I have no problems what so ever.
241_ 17	negative	My biggest concern is that I have found Nokia phones lower quality construction to lead to lower prices, but they also don't last as long.
136_ 2	positive	Another 5 star performance.
319_ 0	neutral	I bought this product after reading the Editor's Choice article at PC Magazine and had a great experience with Amazon (as usual).
214_ 7	neutral	I have a lot of songs that I need to download.
160_ 1	positive	This router acts as a wireless access point, 100 MB switch and a router making it a nice multipurpose device.
39_ 4	positive	The optical and digital zooms combine to give an effective 4x zoom.
118_ 0	positive	I'm not overly fond of GREEN but when I used this Hitachi M12V it turns out that now I'm very fond of it.
199_ 6	neutral	After reading the reviews, I was all ready for the unit to lock up on me after the initial charge...but it never happened.
40_ 2	positive	because, unless it's small, I won't cary it around.
166_ 26	neutral	Now to get you, they have to trick you into accessing them by sending E-mails, or otherwise enticing you into downloading their mal-ware.
42_ 0	neutral	I was a little skeptical about what people had said about this camera, because it's just so small.
311_ 12	neutral	A security software suite with lots of value
252_ 4	positive	3 band and you can just change the SIM card in it to be able to use it in Europe with another service provider.
227_ 1	neutral	However, if you are considering purchasing one to use with subscription music services like Napster-to-go, or Yahoo Music Unlimited, there are a few things to keep in mind:  1.
5_ 12	negative	4) The camera gets really hot when you are busy snapping away.
210_ 6	neutral	Now I have to wait another few days for them to get back to me again, probably with more worthless suggestions?
89_ 14	neutral	All I do is wipe it down with some antibacterial wipes (takes about 10 seconds!!) and then maybe spray some Lysol in it and let it air out for a minute or two.
256_ 4	negative	DOWNSIDE: It takes a long time to start up.
224_ 13	neutral	This time I'm going to get something a little more reliable - an iPod mini.
155_ 0	neutral	I have been using my router for some months now... I still cant wirelessly access the internet through my laptop but that's a laptop problem.
122_ 1	negative	I was some what sceptical when I seen the price deference between the other makers of comparible HP.
11_ 1	positive	This camera is great if you're used to a high-end SLR.

243_ 7	neutral	In July of 2004, I purchased a Nokia 6600 from T-Mobile.
243_ 16	neutral	The older security method is called Unit Key.
166_ 30	neutral	Windows security and most routers are not compatible on all levels.

221_ 25	neutral	A bargain $200.
0_ 58	positive	Powerup is quick, and you can even set your favorite image to display for a second or so as it turns on.
93_ 4	neutral	I couldn't picture myself yelling to hubby, "Honey, I know you have sixty other things to get...can you also pick up refills for the diaper pail?"
234_ 5	negative	When you dial a number, you'll need to check the screen to see that the number entered is correct.
233_ 22	positive	This isn't the most rugged phone ever but then your not gonna play aeroplane with this,are you.
211_ 12	neutral	When it's being used or charged it emits a low pulsating blue light.
193_ 31	positive	A distinct IPod relation is evident with white colored cables, power plug and the very nice Zen case with a white rubber inside covering.
242_ 11	positive	The 6600 has more ameneties than most - World phone, Camera (VGA/zoom/night mode/timer), Video (w/ audio & zoom), Speaker (good sound), Bluetooth, infrared, Modem for computers, electronic wallet, Internet access, Calendar, calculator, converter and more.
256_ 1	positive	UPSIDE: This one, like most Nokias, receives a consistently strong signal (I've tried some Samsung and Sony Ericsson models which were very weak on the reception front).
207_ 23	negative	Yes, there is a belt clip, but that doesn't hold the extra battery and usb cable.
215_ 2	neutral	Its $4.99 a month ($60 annually) to download as much music as you like.
220_ 10	negative	It seems like you need to park yourself right next to a radio tower for the Micro to pull in a strong sound.
183_ 42	neutral	6.
201_ 31	positive	You don't need to cough up an extra couple bucks for a "special edition" to get black! - Sound: Awesome! - Batteries: removable/replaceable.
107_ 4	positive	The edge guide is top quality, easy to install and accurate.
0_ 23	neutral	These are some shaky ones I took just after delivery:
174_ 5	neutral	Very easy for visitors to be invisible on all home-marketed boxes.
255_ 7	neutral	I've been on the phone, while browsing the net over a GPRS connection, while sending a text message.
125_ 5	neutral	As much as I like my other routers, I know their limitations because I've pushed them all to them.
155_ 2	neutral	If you want "the newest gadget" get the one with speedbooster.
317_ 1	negative	I'm currently using a Sony Vaio S-150 (which I bought at the end of this past August), and it takes about five minutes just to boot the system - in fact, I've taken to just hibernating, rather than shutting down completely.
152_ 3	neutral	Then this is the way to go.
228_ 5	neutral	Apple never was involved with a lot of audio products until the Ipod.
223_ 9	neutral	This appears to prevent the lockup issue.
132_ 342	neutral	Basically, this is a disposable device, the idea being that when the battery goes out, you will buy the latest model of ipod.
132_ 15	neutral	Yeah, pretty weak.
169_ 13	positive	In a week of use i've never had to reboot the router.
53_ 1	positive	It contains the smell from our baby's diapers and we can use just about any kind of bag inside.
214_ 21	neutral	I feel like it's just me and the music and I am transported into a different world.
25_ 7	negative	I've often struggled to get something to work the way I want it, and hate to have to carry the manual with me all the time!
188_ 12	neutral	you just get used to it after a while.
324_ 8	negative	I had tried to uninstall Norton Internet Security a few weeks ago, and it wouldn't let me do that either.
119_ 8	positive	Enjoy.
132_ 101	positive	Hold Button-- suprisingly not all MP3s have this; this allows you  to have all the buttons unusable, so that you don't accidently hit something in your pocket.
132_ 506	neutral	I love that it allows you to stop and turn it off in the middle of a song if need be, and when you power it back on it will continue right where you left off!
3_ 24	neutral	These are all the flaws I found in the camera,
0_ 132	positive	I tell you now, after lot of shooting in many different situations, this camera is amazing.
132_ 226	neutral	 I have less than 3 GB worth of music, and I don't have any more music in my collection.
132_ 48	neutral	buy it.
0_ 179	positive	Placement of the buttons and software user interface is near perfect.
178_ 6	neutral	Quite frankly though, I've never seen a worse setup process for a piece of hardware.
274_ 2	neutral	So on the whole, let me summarize the good and bad things about this phone, instead of writing a long review.
54_ 10	neutral	There is also no trick to it.
222_ 9	positive	t simply the best player on the market for a really low price, so why look anywhere else?
255_ 3	neutral	Over the past three days, I've only had to turn the phone off twice, so I rarely have to deal with the delay in initially booting the phone.
132_ 185	negative	 Its steel backing picks up fingerprints and scratches easily, not great from a cosmetic standpoint.
249_ 0	negative	At first glance, I thought this phone was a little too big for me, maybe a little too complicated.
248_ 8	negative	If you find a better phone, then I suggest you go for it.
242_ 20	neutral	Less Benz/obvious; more Audi/understated.
191_ 19	neutral	- The FM Radio.
319_ 6	negative	It feels like I'm back to the days of 56k dial-up internet service, even though I'm running a Dell 2GHz Pentium 4 with 256MB memory and have had excellent broadband service for the past year.
109_ 2	negative	The only problem i find with it is that the plunge mechanism will eventually stick due to wood dust.
263_ 9	positive	The speed is the same as dail up, where i live we do not have wifi everywhere so this is my version of it until we catch up.
193_ 22	neutral	Actually only three players are on the list for Napster To Go.
250_ 0	positive	I do not need to repeat what's great about this phone.
242_ 30	neutral	RECEPTION: This really depends on locale & carrier.
163_ 5	neutral	There may be many theories as to why they've done this, but a logical argument is that with a faster processor and more memory, they Linksys device may compete a little to close to the Enterprise-Class Cisco devices.
199_ 10	neutral	A few reviewers have also complained about the printed manual which is probably one of the biggest wastes of paper ever included with an electronic device.
146_ 11	positive	drops and strong signals even from the backyard.
132_ 0	neutral	Don't get this...keep browsing.
214_ 8	neutral	I was going to purchase a pink one and then decided that I'd get a purple one because that's my favorite color....however Circuit City had it for $10 cheaper ($219.00) in black and I could !
0_ 112	positive	I take a lot of pictures and this camera is my first choice.
270_ 0	positive	Have had the Nokia 6600 for a year now and am generally very happy with it and with T-Mobile.
221_ 28	positive	In conclusion, this player is beautiful.
0_ 204	neutral	Check this one out for yourself for sure!
0_ 222	neutral	An A++!!!
195_ 18	positive	FM tuner & Microphone : Having a tuner in the player is a blessing.
31_ 1	neutral	price[-1][u]I bought it new, when it was cutting edge and very expensive.
109_ 1	neutral	I use it primarily in a router table and have been making my own moldings and trim.
144_ 0	positive	I upgraded from an older 801.11b router to the Linksys WRT54G for its improved security, and of course, speed.
33_ 2	neutral	Before you give up on digital cameras, though, ask yourself a few questions:
183_ 41	neutral	I have gone through two of them in two years. .
192_ 2	positive	The Micro seeemed like an iPod for less.
132_ 53	positive	The software with the iPod includes iTunes, which allows you to play the music on your computer, rip CDs onto your computer, and move your music from the computer to the iPod.
323_ 5	negative	It was immediately noticeable that NIS slows down my computer (Pent4, 256 RAM).
196_ 12	positive	Battery life is exceptional, lasting longer than the 8-10 hours that seem reasonable with most music players on the market.
136_ 8	neutral	Shutting off what they t!
205_ 7	positive	One of my favorite features about the player is its ability to sync to Windows Media Player.
250_ 1	neutral	A few things that I want to suggest for improvements:
83_ 9	neutral	I am very pleased with our choice.
97_ 0	negative	Gets stinky after a few months, the seal on the piston doesn't seal anymore.
239_ 0	neutral	Sure, it is a relatively bulky, but it is really packed with many great features.
283_ 5	negative	So far I haven't had so much complaints except that I still haven't mastered how to scandisk when using Internet Security.
225_ 21	neutral	and labels it before you burn the CD into the Zen.
66_ 3	neutral	Now for our third child I saw the Diaper Champ and figured why not register for it and try it out.
132_ 78	neutral	I'd never had an MP3 player before, so this was a new one on me.
135_ 9	neutral	(Didn't find that out until I talked to someone in technical support an hour later.
171_ 3	neutral	Both routes take me a few minutes of precious time when i would be online doing something important.
132_ 88	neutral	Now, I can back up what little I  keep on my computer quickly and without a fuss.
194_ 9	neutral	The radio and voice recording are nice.
214_ 9	neutral	pick it up from the store.
146_ 12	positive	The WRT54G offers excellent security features and much more (and easier) configuration menu that I didn't even need a manual to setup correctly.
0_ 154	positive	Moreover, apart from the plastic cable cover, the camera has a nice, solid feel about it, and it's so tiny, I take it with me wherever I go.
15_ 11	neutral	The closest competitor is the SONY DSC-P1 (3.3mp).
3_ 18	negative	The flash is very weak.
138_ 6	negative	There were no other obvious setup instructions - though there was a softcopy manual, it did not give an answer readily on what do to.
242_ 52	negative	I would suggest this phone for all but the simple-minded... or those who simply don't need so many features.
234_ 8	negative	It's as though Nokia has segregated 90% of the screen for fancy features rarely used and leave just 10% for the day to day use.
106_ 5	neutral	And changing bits requires one hand on the wrench, one hand on the spindle lock, and two knees to hold the router -- another reason why the M12V is best used in a table.
186_ 1	neutral	With so many choices it was a tough decision.
183_ 12	neutral	Why isn't it?
306_ 0	neutral	I had Norton Internet Security 2003 and it worked great...one of the features that I liked was the user interface as well as the ad/pop-up blocking feature along w/the logs on internet usage.
189_ 32	positive	You can use it as a storage Hard Drive.
213_ 0	neutral	so i admit it... i wanted a zen micro, because the appeal of the iPod was overshadowed by it's annoying trendy hipster popularity and i felt better about myself for choosing a rip off version of that trendy hipster popularity.
241_ 18	positive	I can tell using the phone that it feels a little flimsier than Motorolas do, but as long as I'm not planning on dropping the phone or running over it with my car it should be just fine.
3_ 17	negative	Even just turning the camera on will move the lens a little, resulting in a noisy start-up.
132_ 79	negative	 The interface took a little getting used to.
196_ 10	positive	It fits comfortably in my shirt pocket and while very well-designed, doesn't look to ostentatious while I'm walking around with it.
132_ 393	neutral	  I also got to see just how utterly addicted I am to my iPod in the few weeks I had to go without one.
132_ 442	neutral	 Warranty expires only after a year.
132_ 427	neutral	 For about $5! 6 dollars, you can get an "extended warranty" and apple will replace the battery within 2 years if it dies.
132_ 161	negative	 You can't change the battery, so I don't know what I'm going to do in a year or so.
89_ 19	positive	All in all, this product is definitely one I would recommend and certainly worth the very reasonable price.
222_ 4	positive	The software is very easy to use, and the transfer is super fast!
139_ 15	neutral	However, the version of the WRT54G that Amazon.com and most other places sell is version 5.
3_ 8	negative	First off, the battery.
290_ 2	neutral	This package contains BOTH Norton Antivirus and Firewall.
23_ 1	positive	I purchased the Elph s100 mainly because I thought it was cool.
136_ 14	neutral	No Wires !
15_ 17	neutral	You take around 12 pictures in a circle, stitch them together and voila; you have a perfect memory of where you were standing !
315_ 1	positive	No more banner ads, pop-ups, and the reliable antivirus.
76_ 3	neutral	4 months later.
13_ 1	negative	I then realized a major design flaw.
270_ 3	positive	The sound quality is excellent and the speaker phone couldn't be easier to use.
29_ 2	neutral	I am no computer expert, and this is my first (and probably last) digital camera.
132_ 150	neutral	 a week passed but it was never picked up.
132_ 45	positive	 Very sturdy and strong.
136_ 21	neutral	So 54 Megabytes per second is about a thousand times faster than a standard modem.
181_ 5	negative	Most of us just want to plug and play, not spend a year navigating a maze of complicated options...like transfering everything on a hard drive to this stupid thing.
132_ 63	neutral	 You can also use it as an external hard drive to back-up documents, photographs, etc.
132_ 24	neutral	 There is an alarm and timer, but most MP3 players have this feature.
270_ 6	negative	The only problem is the size of the keys.

15_ 18	negative	The pictures are a little dark sometimes.
0_ 205	neutral	I have not been this happy about a purchase I have made in a long time.
169_ 0	neutral	I purchased the WRT54G about a week ago.
241_ 9	negative	The only problem is that occasionally the joystick does start to dig into your thumb while gaming.
0_ 143	neutral	If you like to take a look at some pictures shot with this camera by a mediocre photographer please feel fee to check out my picture page at http://community.webshots.com/user/mbs60099
132_ 126	neutral	  This is a hassle, of course, but I'm not sure if the problems are to blame on poor construction, cold weather, or misuse by yours truly.
102_ 1	positive	From the Internet, woodworking books, local stores and personal opinions the Hitachi M12V 3-1/4 HP router time and time again came up to be the router of choice or best for its price.
132_ 527	neutral	Or simply rate its performance in relation to other products?
106_ 10	neutral	Accessories included in the package are: - 1/2" shank, 1/2" diameter, 1" cutting length, 2 carbide flute straight bit - parallel guide - template guide - template adapter for 3rd-party guides - 1/4" chuck sleeve - cutting depth fine adjustment knob (which takes a "13 mm" wrench to install, but a crescent wrench works OK too)
213_ 9	neutral	Aren't they something of digital sound experts?
242_ 31	positive	The 6600 (T-Mobile) is the true 'world phone' in that it has the mhz to operate around the globe, including New Zealand and Australia (900) whereas the  6620 (available from Cingular) replaces it w/ 800mhz (some refer to as 850).
256_ 15	positive	Probably a great phone overall, and perhaps mine just has bugs.
298_ 33	negative	Just the home version of Norton Internet/AV has too many glitches and problems to even remotely bother with.
279_ 7	positive	I am just in love with this phone, especially after using a more primitve phone about 3 years.
306_ 1	negative	I read many reviews on Norton I.S. 2004 from a variety of sources (Cnet, Amazon, message boards) and came to the conclusion that NIS 04 was a terrible product and not worth the update.
189_ 33	neutral	Now, about the iTunes.
233_ 7	neutral	My dad has a Nokia 6670 before which he has a Nokia 7210 and before that he had a Nokia 6610.
194_ 4	positive	It holds plenty of songs.
0_ 216	positive	I have a Canon A 70 , and now this SD500, its amazing, how this little camera produces, such great pics, it even brings out ur pimples on the face.
163_ 2	neutral	They've gone from 16 MB of RAM in version 4 to 8 MB of RAM in version 5.
166_ 1	neutral	Networking computers is quite beyond the capabilities of those, who used to think you had to keep the TV on to record it from your VCR.
183_ 24	neutral	If you want a wall-socket recharging cord, you have to dish out somewhere between $30 and $35, plus shipping and handling, for a cord that cost less than $1 to manufacture and market.
139_ 23	neutral	If you are a tech person and want to really play with your WRT54G, sorry, but you need to get the WRT54GS router.
242_ 15	positive	I've had no problems w/ this phone.
276_ 4	negative	DOwnside is the size of the phone, it is BIG for today's standard.
213_ 12	neutral	before i get into the cons, i'll make a note about the scrollpad.
263_ 12	neutral	the stand by is really good considering all the toys this phone has and the screen size!
119_ 7	positive	You just can't go wrong with this one!
132_ 251	neutral	 I mean, it would be nice if one day, iTunes can actually offer their customers a monthly service that allows iPod owners to load their iPods up with unlimited music with one set fee, as an option to the pay-99cents-a-track path.
193_ 24	positive	It was also the most appealing.
5_ 9	negative	This is due to the unusually slow autofocus system.
136_ 35	neutral	Hope this helps.
127_ 6	negative	Two, the single wrench just doesn't work well.
304_ 3	positive	Anyhow, this software is working fine and no problems since I installed it two weeks ago.
166_ 53	neutral	What about the wireless capability, you ask.
193_ 50	neutral	My hobby is home audio and home theater.
221_ 24	neutral	And the price?
91_ 12	negative	CONS - Difficult to open to change bag-twice my bags caught on a sharp edge inside and snagged as I was pulling out-leaving dirty diapers all over the floor.
195_ 41	positive	FM transmitter (belkin has a good one) to use Zen with your car Sterio FM Tunner   Latest Find: Connected this baby to my $3800 audiophile audio system and it produced clean sound compared to Ipod.
100_ 1	positive	This is really a nice diaper pail.
184_ 2	positive	Smaller size, 1 gb of more space, radio, voice recording, removable battery, cooler look, all in one.
43_ 0	positive	I've had this camera just over 2 years and it takes pretty good pictures.
35_ 19	positive	The manual modes give you a lot of control over exposure and white balance (but there is no manual focus or manual exposure).
251_ 7	negative	2- It is bulky and the small buttons on the sides are sloppy to use .
89_ 1	positive	I decided to go with the Diaper Champ rather than the more popular Diaper Genie, because I didn't like the idea of having to buy special bags.
0_ 52	neutral	All had the same results.
209_ 27	neutral	You may need to briefly disable various spam blockers, cookie swatters, and antivirus programs (I know, I know -- get offline first).
253_ 2	neutral	So, do I recommend the 6600?
132_ 410	neutral	 With both pairs I had ceramic rattling in my ears by month two.
23_ 3	neutral	In practice, we've been VERY happy with the results.
104_ 3	negative	If you think you are saving $40 getting the Hitachi, you are right, and you are also getting a router worth $40 less than a Makita.
128_ 0	neutral	I use the Hitachi M12V in a router table.
105_ 5	positive	So for the money it costs for one of those top-of-the-line models I've got a good router & a nice table to put it in & I like that.
0_ 156	positive	As it turns out, this is an awesome camera!
249_ 7	neutral	The ONLY bad thing?
287_ 38	negative	Once again it won't reinstall, even with online and email assistance from Symantect Technicians.
183_ 44	negative	As I wrote, this COULD have been a great product, but expect hidden charges (read gross profiteering and price gouging) as the company royally sticks you on every conceivable accessory necessary for normal daily usage.
0_ 159	neutral	CNET told you not to look for advanced controls.
17_ 2	negative	The new drivers on cannon's site do not help at all but try them if you want they have made me have to use the backup software.
298_ 14	neutral	The SystemWorks 2005 seems to be working GREAT!!
198_ 3	neutral	I emailed the company and after 2 days was told to read their Q&A site and then download again.
264_ 1	positive	Camera quality isn't bad for the low resolution.
99_ 5	neutral	We just bought another for baby boy number two coming next month.
5_ 1	positive	It has given me zero problems, and the more I use it, the better I become at taking advantage of its strengths.
242_ 37	positive	It films 10 second video, for crying out loud.
189_ 44	neutral	But if you get that "fuzzy legal feeling" from paying for songs, at least buy them from allofmp3.com, there are no restrictions and the songs cost pennies.
287_ 26	positive	These tasks are faster and easier than in prior versions, and I found the menu to be much more navigable.
58_ 0	neutral	My daughter is now 2 and 1/2, and I am still enjoying this product.
211_ 18	neutral	But after a few firmware releases it's working without a hitch.
110_ 15	positive	Less than a cheap cordless drill or a laminate trimmer.
74_ 1	positive	I use the same store-brand tall kitchen trash bags I already use in the kitchen for it -- no special "diaper" trash bags necessary.
203_ 4	negative	Screen review could be better.
263_ 5	negative	the OS is abit confusing at 1st, but within a few days you will pass this learning curve!
208_ 11	negative	On the downside, I think the interface takes some getting used to and the Zen software !
216_ 3	neutral	This is by far my biggest complaint.
16_ 3	negative	The price is $... more.
166_ 40	neutral	Ok, so what can we say about this particular network product?
281_ 7	negative	I have never had this problem with any other software on my computer.
268_ 4	positive	One primary reason for getting a cell phone was so that I could use it as an internet connection for my laptop running linux, where softmodem drivers are hard to find, and don't work very well.
85_ 3	neutral	Only problem.
220_ 15	positive	Have not had any issues with the headphones or fragility.
189_ 1	neutral	If you're not computer savvy or if you want things as simple as they can be, get the iPod.
281_ 4	negative	During install, NIS would either freeze or not reboot properly when asked to do so.
54_ 9	positive	We use the cheap $1.99 13 gallon vanilla scented bags from the grocery store but you can use any bag you have laying around.
100_ 8	positive	We just use the Glad tall kitchen trash can bags with odor shield from Target and they work wonderfully.
67_ 3	neutral	Presto!
5_ 7	negative	Its size makes holding it steady for long a bit of a challenge (not enough camera body to grip with more than your finger tips).
233_ 42	neutral	Did I mention the note feature and how you can send notes via Bluetooth?
132_ 475	neutral	 The first time I took it in the car, and was able to chose from hundreds of CD titles, thousands of songs, to have all of that at my fingertips was a great experience.
268_ 17	neutral	Apparently some phones don't allow you to give an entire group a ringtone.
195_ 12	neutral	Zen micro does.
169_ 14	neutral	There is also a Panasonic cordless phone (2.4 Ghz) between the wap and the ethernet bridge but it never causes a problem.
174_ 7	neutral	Netgear and Dell (which I think may be DLink rebranded) do.
132_ 261	neutral	 It "feels" much more professional and well built - the clickable scroller, for example, is a brilliant invention and I never feel as if I'm going to perhaps break it or snap it off (as I sometimes did with the Nitrus).
82_ 0	positive	It holds almost a week's worth of diapers, and you don't need expensive refills - any kitchen bags work.
171_ 4	negative	Stay away from this junk.
138_ 22	positive	I'd give it 4.5 stars if possible, but since 5 stars would be misleading, I give it 4 stars.
132_ 124	negative	 First, let me say that I got the 20gb iPod for Christmas, and I most likely would not have spent the $300 myself.
214_ 11	positive	And I must say...this MP3 is very cool.
132_ 271	neutral	 My only nitpick with this is that it sometimes doesn't work on certain files and presents error messages.
41_ 0	neutral	My first impression of Elph S100 was that there couldn't POSSIBLY be room in the thing for anything other than a battery and a memory card.
128_ 3	positive	I like the speed control.
180_ 2	neutral	It's very frustrating to try to complete school work or work, only to lose it because I am dropped every couple of minutes.
179_ 13	neutral	All this took a couple of hours fidling, as I did not go to Linksys website for support - so I wouldn't know if there is help there.
132_ 418	neutral	A lot of the reviews I've read talk about IPODS in general.
15_ 3	neutral	On a battery charge, the camera takes approximately 70 pictures, where the camera is opened and closed between pictures.
119_ 0	neutral	This router is 1 of 4 in my shop.
206_ 1	positive	This year, it seems that I choose my timing perfectly, having discovered the awesome device that is the Zen Micro.
248_ 5	neutral	Its like having a 66Mhz computer with a webcam, fax, printer, blue tooth...etc...Just an example..
270_ 17	positive	I recommend T-Mobile and the Nokia 6600 without reservation.
193_ 49	positive	At 128 the songs sound very good.
206_ 14	positive	Songs transfer lightning fast, and the two batteries that came in my box give me 24 hours of listen time.
142_ 9	neutral	Be sure to call your ISP with the modem's MAC address to get online.
189_ 26	positive	Record memos using the built in microphone.
275_ 2	neutral	i checked the iSync compatibility page and it was listed--they even had a photo of the 6600 shown in the graphic.
210_ 7	neutral	And t!
223_ 13	neutral	This was probably the biggest reason I chose the Micro over an iPod.
241_ 5	positive	Handset quality is great, as is the speakerphone quality and the headset audio quality.
0_ 174	positive	The included software removes any red eye easily.
233_ 30	neutral	Now that is neat.
291_ 3	negative	Stay away from this product!
35_ 3	positive	Even with the waterproof housing it is small.
255_ 11	neutral	In short, I don't have a single negative thing to say.
128_ 13	positive	The power, low noise operation, and speed control makes up for the problems I have experienced.
238_ 0	neutral	i bought this phone last march, almost a year ago, in saudi arabia (it came out there before it did here).
306_ 19	negative	Basically, I ate the cost of the renewal and ate the cost of the Tech Help.
129_ 1	neutral	Until recently it was my only router.
227_ 4	neutral	At the time of this writing, that firmware is a "beta release."
211_ 20	positive	The accesories that come with the player are great.
106_ 17	neutral	Bottom line: Highly recommended, but best when used in a table.
55_ 5	negative	My daughter is only 4 months old and we do notice an odor.
132_ 146	neutral	i didnt touch the product.
80_ 1	neutral	dirty diapes and soaked diapers.
126_ 0	neutral	I reciently purchased this when a 1 1/2hp plunge router (different name brand) couldn't hack it.
232_ 4	positive	Especially the LCD is big and the camera quality is among the very best around.
195_ 1	neutral	Space : 5GB =2500 songs.
132_ 31	neutral	 BATTERY LIFE: Pretty medicore at 12 hours, the Creative, iAudio, Rio, and iRiver players last longer.
225_ 48	neutral	If you send in your Zen to have the flaw fixed, you lose all of the music you've been loading into the thing for 2-3 months, which came out to 1022 songs and 80 albums for me.
187_ 18	positive	Utility Its got a huge list of features including an FM Recorder a Calender and contacts list.
105_ 4	neutral	Have to clean, buff & lube the plunge rods once in a while but I see that as a non issue because any router should be periodically cleaned anyway.
188_ 3	neutral	by broken i mean that it would no longer transmit sound.
129_ 5	negative	It would work fine for a while then as the motor warmed up it would die.
155_ 1	positive	As far as dealing with network access of other computers this router is pretty good given the price- remember this router is the same one that was released right when the G standard was introduced to the market.
85_ 1	positive	and we definitely prefer our Champ!
132_ 99	positive	Good sound-- Plays very nicely, even though the stock headphones are kind of weak Durable-- not the most durable because its mostly plastic, but very compact and sturdy
91_ 0	neutral	 We used this diaper pail from the day we brought our son home, until about 13 months.
25_ 9	positive	The pictures are uniformly excellent and color rendering is perfect.
193_ 28	positive	It has a cardboard slip cover with a nice layered box casing inside.
75_ 6	positive	There is no comparison, the chanp is easy and smell free, the genie was difficult to use one handed (which is absolutly vital if you have a little one on a changing pad) and there was a deffinite odor eminating from the genie plus we found that the quick tie garbage bags where the ties are integrated into the bag work really well because there isn't any added bulk around the sealing edge of the champ.
171_ 2	neutral	When that happens i have to restart my pc or restart the linksys router.
0_ 190	negative	Some adjustments in the settings could help make it better.
298_ 8	neutral	The tests were right.
113_ 4	positive	The depth adjustment and bit changing is much easier on the M12V than it was on my old router.
287_ 29	negative	Warning! The Windows "remove program" feature does not do a good job of this, and neither does Norton's own removal program.
190_ 23	negative	Even after all the nightmare sound problems, I'd still half-way like this product if it kept it's promise; the ability to store 1500 songs.
101_ 3	neutral	I tried it with the springs in and with them out and did not notice any difference.
132_ 239	neutral	The iPod does come with other nifty software accoutrements, but honestly I haven't used them much as I use the iPod to listen to music while I run or on a plane.
199_ 14	positive	I also like the fact that you can edit your MP3 titles, etc.
206_ 5	neutral	You ask, yup.
179_ 0	neutral	I tried and failed using the D-Link 624 108M wireless router.
31_ 12	neutral	It requires extensive Photoshopping to fix the flaws.
189_ 18	negative	This fixes some glitches such as the player freezing.
191_ 3	positive	I was fortunate to get the packaging that still included all the accessories (desk stand/hard case, belt clip, wall charger, etc).
242_ 6	negative	Even the instruction booklet is out of order.
0_ 163	positive	Bottom line, this camera will give you a lot of bang for the buck!
298_ 16	neutral	I hope it's better than this hunk of junk Internet/AV 2004 package.
232_ 3	positive	This one is full of features(has bluetooth).
132_ 55	positive	This new click wheel iPod allows you to navigate through the menus and song via a touch-wheel for scrolling and click-able buttons for selection.
313_ 9	neutral	Wish I hadn't renewed my subscription.
71_ 13	neutral	It lives up to its name.
242_ 42	negative	IMP: Two important pieces of advice - Visit Nokia's site.
279_ 0	positive	This phone is one of the milestones in the history of the cellular phones.
111_ 0	neutral	Bought an expensive Dewalt router some three years ago and never became comfortable with it.
229_ 0	positive	I have had several MP3 players over the past few years, and have to say that this by far is the best that I've owned.
263_ 8	positive	i also use the phone as my modem via bluetooth to my Apple powerbook!
192_ 1	neutral	I bought this a couple of months ago after researching all the reviews comparing with the iPod mini.
209_ 20	neutral	You quickly learn to brush your thumb ever so lightly over its surface.
311_ 7	negative	They said they would refund all the money, but a month later, they tell me now the back-up disc is not refundable as its cost is purely handling and shipping - $15 to "handle" and ship a CD? --and they have been indignant and combative on the phone and in emails.
79_ 23	positive	Regardless to this fact, I believe the Champ is the best way to go.
209_ 11	neutral	ts with Sennheiser HD-497 phones.
54_ 3	neutral	The bags never fit right and then it never spun right.
23_ 2	neutral	I'm a professional photographer using pro digital equipment and I was looking for something to have around the house so that my wife could capture candid moments with my kids.
279_ 6	positive	And also, since it is tri band and since it uses SIM-card, you can just use it in Europe and many other parts of the world, wherever GSM exists.
246_ 3	neutral	Same with the contacts list, recent call list and everything else.
156_ 1	positive	I just replaced my old Linksys router with this one, turned everything on in the right order, and it was up and running with no problems.
304_ 6	negative	Can't get easier than that!
275_ 8	neutral	i guess its my own fault for not researching more before buying the thing.
131_ 7	neutral	But, the first one just stopped working while pushing through the workpiece.
218_ 3	neutral	My big Zen has hundreds of CDs on it, but this little player will store my most listened to tunes, or songs Iwant to download for free from the Yahoo site, "test drive", then decide if I want to download permanently into my larger Creative.
174_ 9	neutral	SSID are like filenames in Windows.
133_ 7	neutral	I do not really know why some people are tearing this router !
82_ 3	neutral	I second that you just need to fold up the diaper (with wipes inside) neatly, but that is not a big deal.
311_ 13	neutral	While I understand the complaints about Symantec's Norton SystemWorks software suite (which are totally justified), the same can't be said for Norton Internet Security.
222_ 2	positive	The sound quality is superb, much better than that of an iPod, in my opinion.
139_ 2	neutral	You will not be able to run 100's users using WPA and WPA2 encryption through this thing, just a handful of people on a cable modem or DSL line.
187_ 4	neutral	The light pulsates when you are charging it almost as if it were breathing.
272_ 3	positive	This way I never have to be ripped off by the carrier for stupid ringtones, I can get whatever I want.
270_ 13	positive	I've had nothing but good luck with T-Mobile.
201_ 6	neutral	I waited a week to make the Micro worthy of a review.
132_ 148	neutral	 they initially told me that i would have to ship it back to them on my own cost.
322_ 7	positive	I downloaded a trial version of Computer Associates EZ Firewall and Antivirus and fell in love with a computer security system all over again.
289_ 1	negative	Then when I went to Norton's website to obtain a priority ID number per the instructions I had been given, I couldn't find a way to get one.
128_ 1	neutral	It is a little large for my table (Rockler), but that isn't the fault of the router.
215_ 7	positive	I thought the FM radio would not see much use with so many tracks avaiable to me, but its great for tuning in to TV programs at the gym while on the treadmill, concerts and programs being simulcast, NPR, and on and on.
26_ 0	positive	The good:  Small size; durable-seeming metal case; easy to use; visually distinctive; good picture quality; fast USB connection; mostly intuitive operation; really cool PhotoStitch software that knits pictures together to give wide panoramas.
166_ 22	neutral	from the cable modem you are using.
0_ 73	neutral	I don't miss the high speed program, nor the manual overide, since I had read numerous reviews and specs. before I ordered.
210_ 4	negative	I was up all night trying to make the stupid thing work, to no avail.
243_ 41	negative	Ultimately you will learn just how bad Nokia is, and why their recent loss of market share is so utterly deserved.
134_ 12	neutral	But can you decide to access the CD manual once you have started the Wizard?
218_ 5	positive	Feature for feature, I find it a very sweet little player; equipped with a higher end headphone system, between this and th larger Zen Ihardly use my home stereo system anymore.
0_ 121	neutral	However, it was not so in my case.
209_ 28	neutral	My gatekeeper programs kept fixes away a few times until I got wise to it.
97_ 3	negative	I gave up and got a diaper Dekor.
0_ 152	positive	As any digital camera owner knows is that when you go to take a picture of a moving object to expect some blurring but with some preliminary testing we had somone move there hands back and forth under the lense and another person take the picture and suprisingly a crystal clear image apeared on the decently sized screen.
304_ 5	negative	If you experience problems with installation, you can visit symantec's website, click the support tab, click the 'home or home office support' and there is an automated support assistant that can scan the Norton program files on your computer and it will tell you what is not working right and how to fix it.
174_ 14	neutral	MAC filtering isn't too hard and it is just a config change on the router.
213_ 8	positive	+Battery life is awesome IF you upgrade the firmware [requires a windows pc] OR make sure to always plug the ac adapter into the player before plugging into the outlet +Awesome sound quality... I mean it is Creative right?
0_ 90	neutral	i just thought it's cute and cool =)
278_ 0	positive	INCREDIBLE MEMORY!
322_ 2	negative	I had much of the same problems that everyone else has listed (mainly the SLOOOOOOOOOW processor), and then I couldn't get the damn thing off my computer completely!
132_ 421	neutral	I'm glad I did.
132_ 216	neutral	They wear out pretty easily when you're changing batteries every week or so.
35_ 9	negative	The auto color balance is often fooled by dense clouds.
15_ 10	positive	It fits in your pocket.
275_ 9	negative	but, i am quite unhappy with nokia at the moment.
95_ 0	positive	Diaper Champ is great.
0_ 123	neutral	Treating my cameras, past and present, with utmost care ensures my investment.
132_ 151	neutral	 the when i called they said they werent responsible for open packages because they couldnt verify it being open when i received it (why else would i want to return it if not for this? if the product was defective i would have complained so) and that if i returned it i would have to pay a 15% restocking fee!  i'm at my wits end with this company.
65_ 6	negative	I have noticed an odor (one the I expected!) when unloading the Diaper Champ but at least you don't smell anything every time you use it.
313_ 7	negative	The only way my pc internet works is if I open the Firewall Program configuration and manually refresh it.
132_ 440	negative	  Cons Breaks easily.
32_ 20	neutral	I've found I can get  from nine to twelve compressed 1600 X 1200 photos on one 8MB card, or 28  images uploaded from my PC.
290_ 5	positive	Norton's memory usage on systems with 512 MB is very low.
325_ 0	neutral	I have been a loyal Norton Anti-Virus and Internet Security software user for as long as I can remember.
166_ 24	neutral	In addition, your port address is now the router, not your computer.
122_ 7	positive	The M12V has been great.
241_ 15	positive	I feel much less likely to drop this phone than others, which are actually starting to get too small.
79_ 11	positive	2) The Champ uses regular store bags.
221_ 10	neutral	Capacity?
201_ 26	negative	It's perfect for those who aren't planning on storing tons of music.
101_ 1	neutral	Well, when I got it home and mounted it in my router table, the shortcomings started showing up.
215_ 8	neutral	When you don't feel like toting a PDA while out for the day (i.e. cycling, window shopping, etc,)simply download everything thru outlook.
193_ 45	positive	The interface works great.
138_ 10	neutral	to which inputs, I know what the lights mean, etc.
285_ 4	neutral	So, if you have a fairly fast computer (1 gig or better) with plenty of ram (512) and your not gaming online or running streaming video continually, you should be fine.
144_ 6	negative	After some research on the Net, I discovered that there is indeed a flaw with the current WRT54G design (WRT54G, version 3, which Amazon currently sells).
268_ 10	neutral	Although the images are not the best in the world, its very handy to have a camera everywhere you go.
229_ 3	neutral	However, their player seems to be defective and Creative Labs should be contacted before making such harsh statements if they haven't been contacted already.
193_ 17	neutral	It was time to exchange it for the other player the Creative Zen Micro 5 GB MP3 Player Black.
207_ 8	neutral	rvice, they said I should send it in for repairs.
229_ 2	neutral	) A previous reviewer has mentioned several different issues with the 'Zen Micro'.
195_ 14	neutral	Remember this is a huge plus when travelling.
186_ 13	neutral	I'm still trying to manage the thing myself, but I've found that if you put the sensitivity to low it is fine.
201_ 1	neutral	Why not join the iPodders like the rest of the world?
132_ 278	neutral	In the meantime, users will obviously begin to install their software - and since the charger takes up the underbelly of the iPod and USB connection to the computer, it's impossible to hook it up to your PC during installation without unplugging the charge adapter and actually turning the iPod on - which we're not supposed to do for 2 - 4 hours!
138_ 5	neutral	So I ran the CD, but doing that did not yield any results - my wired router was apparently too old, so the CD s/w did not recognize it.
0_ 210	positive	I love the camera.
255_ 0	neutral	I've been using this phone for 3 days now, and while I admit that seems doesn't seem like very long -- I should also point out that I've been using it almost non-stop.
225_ 10	neutral	The sonic detail at the highest compression rate(64 kbps WMA) is crazy.
207_ 17	neutral	Y!
278_ 10	positive	I love this phone.
132_ 460	neutral	   Backing up your iTunes library takes a short amount of time.
298_ 11	neutral	We were so fed up that we uninstalled ALL of Norton Internet/AV 2004 and were going to try McAffee, but a techie friend recommended trying Norton SystemWorks 2005 first.
225_ 54	neutral	jack that Creative has acknowledge.
184_ 3	negative	The touchpad is annoying sometimes (give me the click-wheel and pressable buttons any day), but not at all as difficult to get over as other people are saying.
256_ 12	negative	Finally, after about a week's use, the screen started to freeze on me.
217_ 10	neutral	So tack on a scroll wheel and... you still have to compete against the intuitive OS-based application that an iPod offers the user.
75_ 2	positive	This is one of the best purchases we made.
132_ 499	positive	I love the slim design; the weight would only be an issue if it were bulky.
273_ 2	negative	For last one month my Rebate status showing me that my rebate is apporved and check is delivered but still I am waiting for Check.
132_ 283	positive	 The design, as mentioned above, is sleek, cool and trendy (and I think trendy = good, but it's always hard to tell these days).
84_ 1	positive	There is no odor and it is very easy to use.
58_ 9	positive	The container is hard to open, which is exactly what you want when your baby becomes a toddler, and you do have to flip the handle carefully (which has saved more than a few of her toys,too.) I don't consider these difficulties but features for the older baby.
132_ 67	neutral	 I actually had to contact Apple's Vice-president, in order to get the situation resolved.
206_ 4	neutral	To me, the key elements that must be present in an MP3 player are as follows:  -Fast transference of songs to player -Well-designed computer-side interface -Easy menu navigation and well-designed control scheme -Good sound (duh) -Reasonable battery time (~6 Hours)  That's it?
274_ 8	negative	The battery power discharges rapidly especially on using the web browser.
262_ 0	neutral	I find it difficult to remove back cover so is you plan to have a spare battery and replace it I suggest you don't ,besides it has a long battery life.
189_ 38	neutral	And all you do is select all the tracks in the iTunes playlist and drag them to the File Explorer window.
0_ 45	neutral	Wrong, except that my problems are different.
136_ 29	neutral	The operating system is Windows XP.
132_ 466	neutral	 I used it mainly on shuffle play and shut off the "click" sound to get this much life out of it.
128_ 2	neutral	Because of this I have removed the handles.
132_ 422	neutral	  After talking to the salesman, I instead bought the 4G, 20GB (that stands for 4th generation; it looks like a mini - same features), and didn't know that a lot of the ipods out there for sell, including on amazon, are still 3G.
36_ 8	neutral	3- USB kicks!
274_ 9	negative	2) Phone is awfully slow.
0_ 171	positive	 am so glad I bought this camera.
169_ 4	positive	The setup was a breeze, I had some reservations about a wireless network (see my review for linksys wet11)but this item was on sale as well as the WET11 so I just had to splruge.
207_ 3	positive	So, I was one who was ready to give it 5 stars with no complaints at all.
206_ 21	neutral	These are limited to the voice recorder, address book, and such.
129_ 6	neutral	The authorized Hitachi service center said they didn't know what was wrong as they hardly ever get these things in for service.
139_ 19	positive	just want a wireless router for home or your very small business, you can just get a WRT54G from here and configure it.
106_ 2	neutral	Luckily, the only significant handheld use I had to put it to was to plunge cut the melamine board that I dropped my Woodpeckers PlungeLIFT table insert into.
132_ 375	neutral	Most importantly because the iPods warranty is far superior to both these, the Creative Zens is only 90 days, way too short.
189_ 3	neutral	However, since you're reading this review, you want to avoid getting an iPod.
0_ 223	negative	I thought this camera was awful and I did tons of research on CNET and other sites.
55_ 7	positive	If I had to do it over again, even with the cost savings of using any type of bag, I would go w/ the Diaper Genie.
225_ 53	negative	Again, this is a design flaw in the headphone!
132_ 285	neutral	 The list is endless.
233_ 21	positive	Its a tough one this unless you wanna drive your car over it.
213_ 18	neutral	just as well and would be less confusing for new owners, but i guess they wanted to rival the iPod's search wheel.
90_ 2	negative	I wash ours out with lysol each time I empty it, and that helps, but when its hot out- well, just be prepared.
166_ 19	neutral	For one, it clones the Mac address on many systems.
32_ 2	neutral	I had been waiting for the prices of digital cameras to come down before  taking the plunge.
154_ 4	neutral	The setup wasn't quite perfect the first time -- I needed to go through a web-based interface to set up the router (to give  it info on my DSL provider account), though the documentation for this was staightforward.
185_ 9	neutral	Let's face it.
278_ 3	positive	you can record your voice and turn it into a ringtone.
204_ 3	positive	Creative did an awesome job with the design.
221_ 12	positive	Five gigabytes is plenty for my great albums.
12_ 0	positive	It's the same body as the popular ELP2 APS camera (take a look at a standard credit card from your wallet and you'll have an idea of the front profile!).
0_ 107	positive	All in all, this is the camera for you if you can spare the extra cost in price.
207_ 28	positive	I love my dark blue zen micro and would definitely recommend it.
122_ 9	positive	The wood can be pushed thru fast or slow with little bog.
0_ 88	neutral	shake it a little bit and it'l change the background color. if you've holding the camera horizontally, then it will show the time and date horizontally.
196_ 0	neutral	I can't help but feel peeved by the attitude created by Apple enthusiasts that basically detracts from anything that attempts to compete with Apple products in the marketplace.
190_ 4	neutral	On the other hand, you get terrible sound quality.
113_ 0	neutral	This router appeared in my wife's gold box a few weeks ago, and she knew I was looking to upgrade my Craftsman 1/4" fixed base router.
213_ 25	neutral	I definately recommend upgrading the firmware, which is as simple as downloading a program from creatives website and running it with your player plugged in.
0_ 67	negative	I would imagine this is a problem with any camera of a compact nature.
132_ 230	neutral	 I wish I had a long time ago.
199_ 16	positive	After comparing the included Creative earbuds directly against my Sony MD-E828LP's and Sennheiser MX-400's, I find myself still using the Creative's, which in my opinion, sound every bit as good and have a slightly longer cord.
108_ 14	neutral	I plan to get a Porter-Cable for table mounted use but will be using this machine for most if not all of my hand held use.
132_ 357	neutral	THE CLICKWHEEL: Again, I realize that most people think this is the greatest thing since sliced bread.
162_ 5	positive	The best part about this router is now I have a DHCP server.
135_ 19	neutral	! and step by step explanations for all the different setup options and their relevance.
146_ 7	positive	The setup was very easy.
243_ 33	neutral	Two days after they received the phone, I received a letter in my mailbox stating that if I did not pay $120 for the repair of my phone, it would be returned unrepaired.
92_ 1	negative	The only problem i have is with the handle you use to open the top compartment.
134_ 4	negative	It just tells you to start disconnecting and attaching cables without any input as to whether your current setup includes a pre-existing router (mine does), without any clarity as to whether you should be running the wizard on a hard-wired PC or a wireless equipped PC.
35_ 2	neutral	This is the only camera with all these capabilities.
166_ 27	neutral	This is what is commonly called a firewall.
132_ 374	neutral	  I would strongly recommend the iPod over rival mp3 players such as the Creative Zen and the creatively named iRiver.
274_ 14	negative	There will be much erasing of text as, one would tend to type something instead of the actual letters.
0_ 96	positive	i highly recommend this camera to anybody looking for a compact camera that can take good quality pictures.
132_ 56	neutral	It allows fast and easy navigation.
216_ 0	positive	I purchased this over the Ipod Mini because it had several nice features: extra 1G storage, WMA support, replaceable battery, and especially that it wasn't an Apple product with their proprietary architecture.
132_ 188	neutral	  The weight is heavier than many digital players, but I like the solid feel.
132_ 122	positive	 The iPod is a very nice product, which given reasonable care, should give a lot of service.
192_ 6	negative	Limitations: - Not a lot of original accessories like the iPod.
132_ 327	positive	Everything else about the ipod is great, the click wheel is very easy to use and so is the software that comes with it.
36_ 1	positive	VERY smal.
132_ 435	positive	 Really easy to use.
176_ 6	neutral	I can't notice any difference - except it used to drop my connection several times an hour!
260_ 3	negative	T-Mobile wasn't upfront about some of the terms to qualify for the rebate.
263_ 3	neutral	yes it is a bit large, but the realestate on the screen will spoil you!
139_ 1	negative	This is not an enterprise piece of hardware that you will find in an office or corporate environment.
92_ 3	negative	I can't tell you how many times i've chipped a nail or hurt my fingertips because of the force needed to open it.
229_ 11	positive	This program enables the user to batch convert and convert audio files from one format to another.
0_ 177	positive	This is overall the best point and shoot camera I've used.
248_ 4	negative	The navigation takes so much time that it would eventually drive you crazy.
132_ 451	neutral	 held out for the 4th generation 20GB iPod when I heard that it was coming equiped with the 'click wheel', that had previously only been available for the iPod 'mini'.
132_ 414	neutral	  PC users have a lot of choices, but based on what I've heard and read, the iPod really is the best all-around, athough being a Mac product, it has the usual streamlined and comparatively less customizable software.
132_ 518	positive	 Way to go Apple!
142_ 3	neutral	I got it to work with no problem but then I experienced bandwidth loss and constant connectivity issues.
238_ 2	positive	i highly recommend it if you are looking for a phone with great camera quality and/or lots of features you would find in a PDA.
132_ 237	neutral	Perhaps over time I will fill it up, but with almost 250 songs on my iPod now and less than 1GB used, I have a long way to go.
266_ 2	positive	The voice recorders good, but you can't record songs off the radio for ring tones.
248_ 6	neutral	I bet most of the users of this phone would agree.
275_ 12	neutral	but, that's the only SE t-mobile offers right now.
198_ 1	negative	After a week I tried to load some more songs and delete a few but the auto load didn't do anything but turn on my player.
258_ 5	negative	So if you order one of the top 10 bestselling phones from Amazon now, it will take at least 3 weeks for your shipment to be delivered...guess Amazon is waiting for seconds to re-package,
60_ 6	neutral	FANTASTIC!
154_ 3	positive	The card basically installed itself and the "install wizard" on the CD that came with the router basically set the router up to work with one computer (with the 54g card) and also a second computer in my house (with an 11b card).
106_ 15	positive	Nice things about the M12V: - in a table, the powerful 3 1/4 HP motor is great - soft start helps a lot to control the beast when you turn the router on - continuously variable speed control - Amazon's price
76_ 0	positive	I love this pail!
231_ 4	neutral	Simple.
15_ 12	neutral	But that camera is a little larger and you defeat the whole purpose of having a truly portable camera.
132_ 247	neutral	 Now if you do decide to take the iPod on the road, my suggestion is to forego any purchasing of the FM Transmitter devices, unless you live out in the middle of Mississipi because frankly, you'll need a next-clear FM channel on your radio to get any sembelance of a clear signal.
250_ 6	neutral	For phone card with PIN Free dialing setup, you are a little bit lucky.
89_ 11	neutral	Also, making sure that the tape on the diapers is secure will prevent that from happening as well.
306_ 6	neutral	All of a sudden everything that reviewers were writing about NIS 2004 was happening to my computer.
276_ 7	negative	a bit dissapoitnd on that!
132_ 497	neutral	 The iPod is a little more weighty than I expected, but it's not unmanageable.
268_ 28	negative	However, it needs to be quite quiet for it to work at all -- dosn't work at all in the car, for example.
257_ 3	negative	The only con I can think of is the lack of a mega-pixel camera.
311_ 4	negative	I tried to call Norton, and the only numbers they list on their sites are either for Non-tech Customer Service (tried this one and hung up after 75 minute of MUZAC) or they have a $30 tech-support number.
139_ 13	neutral	So, if you type in "Linksys firmware" into Google or A9, you will get a list of websites that have custom firmware for various kinds of Linksys Routers (Linksys makes a few routers that run Linux).
75_ 1	neutral	I hesitated and wondered what I REALLY needed for the nursery.
232_ 0	neutral	I got this with the need for a nokia GSM camera-phone with speakerphone.
212_ 4	negative	Putting the Micro into your pocket could trigger just about anything (unless the hold feature is improved: it asks if you want to "unhold" for every button up press) Second, I'm worried about the durability of the player.
123_ 8	negative	All in all, not very good.
193_ 57	neutral	If you're an itunes person then no one could argue against an IPod.
304_ 9	neutral	For Norton to encourage Spammers by letting them sell their products is a very bad sign.
132_ 432	neutral	I like it.
285_ 3	neutral	I would ask what else these people are running on their computers(?)
135_ 26	neutral	Just make sure to budget a couple of hours for setup, and invite some computer-savvy friends over first if you're prone to high blood pressure.
88_ 0	positive	We have been using our Diaper Champ for almost 14 months now and we are very happy with it.
14_ 0	neutral	I wrote another review and this is the update.
127_ 9	neutral	I am trying to purchase a second wrench, and I think it will improve the function greatly.
251_ 13	negative	Basically the 6600 is a bundle of over-hyped features you don't and won't need (if you do get yourself a PDA or pocket PC) , none of them work as they should , and the basic phone functions and ergonomics are less than average .
298_ 4	neutral	I don't have one good thing to say.
186_ 2	neutral	My first instinct was to go with an iPod.
257_ 5	neutral	Its a real shame that T-Mo does not offer the newer Nokia models.
132_ 158	negative	The Battery does not last 12 hours.
230_ 1	negative	Now, the player's ear phone jack is not working - I have to send it away again.
116_ 2	positive	It's very quiet for a universal motor-driven tool, and the height adjustment stick and variable speed control are great.
176_ 5	neutral	I bought this to replace my Linksys BEFW11S4 - 802.11b wireless router (I gave the old router to a friend - it worked great) because I thought it would be a nice upgrade in speed and performance - WRONG!
193_ 1	neutral	Loved the service so much I decided to buy an MP3 player and upgrade from the basic Napster to Napster To Go.
299_ 4	neutral	After finally restarting, the "automatic updates" ran.
79_ 12	positive	You do not have to waste money or time trying to purchase special bags for the Champ.
242_ 5	neutral	If you've never used an advanced mobile phone before, you might assume this is par for the course, but it simply isn't.
313_ 11	neutral	Wish I had.
132_ 371	positive	  If, like me you simply want an iPod to play your mp3's, buy this one.
0_ 161	negative	I also own a Canon Digital Rebel and I agree that the advanced controls on the SD500 are not as robust, but overall picture quality goes head-to-head with the Digital Rebel.
132_ 508	neutral	However, I have found that converting my CD's and MP3's into the iTunes library fo!r upload takes a fairly annoying chunck of time.
99_ 8	positive	We just recently had to buy another roll of bags. SO $6.00 for a year of bags- can't beat that!!
132_ 254	neutral	By far the best MP3 player I've ever used
192_ 15	neutral	I wish they has a "lock" function like cell phones to prevent this.
71_ 3	positive	Even though I never ventured into the cloth land, I was very impressed by how well this works at keeping diapers and their accompanying odor in the pail and out of our life!
233_ 14	neutral	There's a whole lot of things you can do with this phone besides reading a book , playing various Java games , having a variety of software installed.
0_ 50	neutral	LCD works fine for reviewing images already on the card so it, the LCD, still works, however the camera will not allow new pictures to be taken.
128_ 8	negative	Finally, I gave up and I purchased a Router Razier.
132_ 207	neutral	  If Apple makes no attempt to at least create an equivalent type of service, they are failing to compete with the market.
40_ 1	positive	So, why the small Digital Elph, rather than one of the other cameras with better resolution or picture quality?
136_ 32	positive	All in all this is a 5 star piece of equipment.
256_ 10	negative	Also, when I dial an "800" number like an airline, it will not allow me to use number keys to navigatee the prerecorded menu.
242_ 27	neutral	If you max out the phone memory and have sent all you wish to a computer, there is a memory card w/ a good deal of storage as well.
240_ 9	neutral	Is it really slow, or what?
243_ 37	negative	This simple nuance was too much for Nokia, and they still refuse to acknoledge the fact that their technician could have broken the phone or repair the phone for free.
199_ 4	neutral	Not to mention that everyone else at the office has an IPod, so I was kinda' hoping for a good alternative.
225_ 50	neutral	It comes loose after 3 months-give or take-of careful use.
324_ 5	neutral	I just about lost it this morning with this software.
187_ 17	positive	Best of all the WMAs(I have a lot of them) sound great.
215_ 3	neutral	You can fill it up with anything you like out of there 1 Million song library.
221_ 30	positive	But it; you won't regret it.
178_ 24	negative	Even the PDF manual that comes with it is pretty vague for someone not familiar with "MAC settings", etc.
138_ 1	neutral	I had an old wired Linksys router.
169_ 5	positive	To set up the xbox, wap, and ethernest bridge, with the encryption on was less then 30 mins.
201_ 17	neutral	Functionality, menus are easy to navigate... As many have mentioned, the touch pads take some time to get used to, but I've gotten used to it.
25_ 4	positive	The PhotoStitch software is very cool if you want to do any 360 degree panorama shots.
243_ 28	neutral	After over two hours of being placed on hold and persuasion, a supervisor finally agreed to fix the phone for free.
59_ 2	negative	It seemed as if we were empting the pail everyday and it was in no way odorless.
132_ 364	neutral	 The Sony Walkman and Creative Zen Touch get 30 and 24 hours per charge, respe
312_ 0	negative	I've alway liked Symantec products, except for this version 2004.
193_ 8	neutral	The buttons are located on the sides making it difficult to use.
258_ 1	negative	But if you are one of the customers contributing to this, its a big mistake.
251_ 6	negative	1-A cell phone is to make CALLS , in other words , quality of reception and mic/speaker are the most important , the 6600 has a relatively low volume speaker , you'd have to press it hard against your ear to hear anything the other person is saying , unless the surroundings were completely quiet .
189_ 19	neutral	POSITIVES:  Reasons for getting the Zen Micro instead of the iPod:  1.
132_ 304	neutral	When I first saw "music trivia quiz" I thought it was some pre-programmed elitist thing - it's not.
129_ 10	positive	Overall it is a great value.
79_ 15	neutral	This will never be a problem with the Champ.
267_ 5	positive	5. Check traffic411.com for LA traffic on the 405.
0_ 135	positive	Fits comfortably in my inside jacket pocket or in my pants pocket.
214_ 26	neutral	I would say the only thing I need to adjust is the sensitivity of the touch pad.
38_ 3	neutral	I love not having to go to Walgreen's to get my pictures develpoed anymore!
199_ 18	neutral	Zen Micro[+2][s] Overall, I'm very pleased with the Zen Micro and based on my experience with it (as well as it's older sibling Creative Nomad IIC), can recommend it without reservation.
132_ 121	neutral	And it's easily connected to a Linux or FreeBSD machine for loading and unloading files, so I can also retire my ZIP drive.
216_ 4	negative	Another problem is that the latest 2.0 firmware upgrade moves you into Windows Media Player 10 which seems to be very, very slow for downloads.
128_ 12	positive	All in all I am pleased with the router.
7_ 2	positive	Take quick pictures with excelent resolution
132_ 98	positive	 Great Design-- Very sleek and touch wheel has still never been successfully copied (vertal ones are the only competition); and now the wheel clicks, taking away a lot of headaches from 3rd gen and very navigable in the menus.
296_ 2	negative	Im at full capacity!!!! I called Symantic and they said they don't know why but I should get Tech's Support at $35/hr to help!! I did call them and was on hold for 55 minutes untill I hung up!
228_ 3	neutral	It is unlikely that you will EVER get the best products just by sticking with one company.
201_ 22	positive	Speaking of battery, it's removable AND replaceable!
193_ 14	neutral	All this before I found out the bad news.
174_ 16	neutral	Easy and a basic step, but if you have suspicious teenae computer geeks in the area, maybe not enough for privacy.
127_ 3	positive	I use it on a router table, and it is works well.
313_ 1	neutral	It can be a pain to configure, but I dealt with it.
252_ 5	positive	Bottom line great phone for the time being.
138_ 16	positive	The router works fine for both wired and wireless.
73_ 3	neutral	Here's what we love about this pail.
132_ 272	neutral	I had similar trouble with my Soundgarden CD - the ripped tracks continually failed to convert properly to MP3.
287_ 25	positive	Once installed, however, some of the functions do work OK (Disk Doctor, One Button Checkup, and WinDoctor).
21_ 0	neutral	My last digital camera was an Apple QuickTake 200, which shot 640x480 pixel images.
190_ 14	negative	The eq is awful, and even at top volumes, the bass is flat sounding.
227_ 14	neutral	Subscription files need to buffer when you first hit "play," so there's a 4-7 second delay before the first song starts.
213_ 6	positive	+looks snazzy +smaller than a pack of smokes - easily transported +ac charger included as well as a hardshell that comes with a clip and a stand adapter +USB cable !
253_ 1	positive	Multimedia functions are enhanced by multi-slide MMS messages and a Gallery for organizing digital content captured or downloaded with the phone.
5_ 13	negative	It is hot enough to be annoying.
122_ 2	neutral	I bought it!
210_ 3	neutral	I tried everything to make it work - followed advice from Microsoft support, uninstalled and reinstalled the whole thing, rebooted every five minutes, ran a virus scan on my computer, checked my drives for errors, everything.
207_ 15	neutral	I didn't experience any problems with the software or getting my computer to recognize the player.
107_ 2	positive	The soft start is a tremendous help for this type of operation.
243_ 12	negative	Though nearly a dozen different people at both T-Mobile and Nokia have told me otherwise, it is simply not possible to use this phone as a Bluetooth modem for the vast majority of PDAs and many other devices.
119_ 4	positive	I use the router with a 3 1/2in raised panel bit with no problems.
35_ 11	negative	The dynamic range seems not quite as good as the Kodak DC260.
81_ 6	neutral	I had to go and pull the crumpled foam out just so we could turn the lid.
246_ 5	negative	The number buttons are crammed into a 3x4cm area, the fonts are small, the interface is too convoluted and frustrating, it's not that customisable as well.
315_ 4	positive	This product is way cooler than anything Ive used before (PcCillins and McCafees and Norton Antivirus alone).
138_ 0	neutral	It did not take me that long to set this up, but it did require *not* following the instructions.
233_ 1	negative	I purchased this phone knowing it was slightly old as compared to the newer models of Nokia phones available.
166_ 17	neutral	Unless you backed up the documents, and other things you created, (data) that will be lost too.
132_ 153	neutral	There's got to be a better solution...
151_ 0	neutral	My old Linksys router recently died after 2.5 years of service.
283_ 2	negative	The latest of Internet Security has antispam function that is helpful because I has received a mountain of those these days.
213_ 24	negative	-User's guide doesn't cover a lot of important info that is covered on their website.
253_ 3	negative	Yes, certainly.
185_ 0	neutral	I am one of the many people who (a) are PC Based and (b) can't stand to see the multitudes of people with those funky white headphones that belong to Ipod users.
183_ 23	neutral	Infuriating! Nearly all other MP-3 producing companies include a recharging cord with their product that can be plugged into a wall socket.
107_ 13	positive	This is a great deal, and I'm elated with my decision to go with Hitachi's green machine.
170_ 7	neutral	After installing the firmware hold the reset button at the back for 30 secs.
0_ 208	neutral	This is my third digital Elph and it is definitley the best ever.
123_ 7	negative	I sent it back, as I think that the speed control is either poorly designed or defective.
168_ 5	positive	The darn thing works as promised and it's amazingly cheap too.
132_ 330	neutral	 You can put songs in multiple categories, which is great.!
116_ 1	positive	For the money, I'm not sure you can do better.
75_ 3	neutral	The champ, the baby bjorn, fluerville diaper bag, and graco pack and play bassinet all vie for the best baby purchase.
0_ 122	neutral	$500 may not be a lot of money for some, but it is for me.
208_ 8	neutral	I primarily got the Zen to use for band practice, so I use the removable disk to store lyrics and sheet music.
280_ 1	neutral	Why is it that I can install any other type of software and it installs and works properly?
243_ 30	neutral	All that had to be done was restore the software to the phone, and all that took was a cable and some Nokia software.
135_ 8	negative	Too bad they don't mention anything about how the CD can't be used with a Mac.
211_ 11	neutral	m.
228_ 9	positive	It beats Apple on the storage space, it beats apple on the removable battery (and batter life), and I personally like its interface more than the Ipod scroll wheel.
228_ 4	neutral	What is the conjunctive probability that each successive product release will be without flaws or that the company isn't having turnover in the R&D department (or making bad management decisions)?
115_ 3	negative	That said, I am disappointed in the plunging mechanism.
84_ 3	positive	And it's the largest diaper pail I've seen without taking up more floor space.
231_ 5	positive	It has it all.
233_ 34	negative	Anyhow some demerits of this phone, The phone has a slow processor and the ear volume is lower than 6610 but then the 6610 has the best ear volume among most Nokia variants.
132_ 135	neutral	 I have several hundred songs from burned albums, at they all worked fine.
187_ 10	negative	The touch controls took a little getting used to but now I wouldn't change it for the scroll wheel.
105_ 6	neutral	Happy woodworking!!
79_ 20	neutral	I cannot speak to the accuracy of its odor containing capabilities due to it was working overtime with 2 childrens diapers.
0_ 6	neutral	If you want something resembling a REAL and professional review before plunking down your $500.00, I suggest going to dpreview or dcresource and reading the reviews there.
287_ 21	negative	When I finally got it working, it only worked properly for many a month.
280_ 2	negative	But if I installed either one of these Norton products, neither works after installation?
161_ 0	neutral	Bought this a few months ago with the Laptop card.
233_ 15	positive	The Phone offers a 32 Mb MMC card and I think that is certainly the most exciting feature.
320_ 8	positive	I installed, activated and registered NIS 2004 without issue.
212_ 6	negative	Last, i find the price a bit expensive for a product such as this.
318_ 0	positive	I've owned many Norton products in my time, and for the most part, I've been pleased with their performance.
39_ 3	neutral	Now I can take over 300 1600 x 1280 shots (or for the webshot fanatic, 1,141 pictures at 640 x 480).
188_ 2	negative	HOWEVER after just one month my headphone jack was BROKEN as a result of normal, every-day use.
132_ 279	neutral	Confused yet? Don't be.
120_ 1	neutral	This is my second one.
143_ 3	positive	there are instructions to encrypt your personal wirless network so no one else can end up hogging/stealing your bandwidth.
3_ 20	negative	The last problem I found with this camera was the macro function.
283_ 3	negative	Other than that it is all the same except the new updates.
144_ 13	neutral	The reader can find a better product with the competition and at a lower cost.
225_ 42	neutral	chargeable battery runs out; thereby, waiting 3 weeks to get it back, and possibly with all of your music erased.
183_ 17	neutral	2.
251_ 0	neutral	Most of thew reviews are high for this phone ......
107_ 6	positive	This was possible due to the variable speed settings for any sized bit.
71_ 2	neutral	She never wore even one- the hospital started me on Huggies, and I never turned back (as a side note- if you do have the patience for cloth diapers, pay the extra $ and go for Kushies; they're beautifully made and work very well from what I've heard).
188_ 14	positive	all-in-all, its good enough for its price as long as it doesnt break again due to normal use.
324_ 13	neutral	Finally I ran msconfig and went into the "services" tab and unchecked every last Norton/Symantec "service," then ran uninstall again.
264_ 4	neutral	You have to wait to get your second bill before you can send the rebate form in. \
274_ 6	negative	Now the bad:  1) As usual, battery power not sufficient for daily usuage.
220_ 6	neutral	Now the downside:  One of the features that factored into my choice of a Micro!
293_ 2	negative	It is buggy, slow and basically frustrates the heck out of the user.
124_ 5	positive	The edge guide has a nice micro adjust feature that works well.
132_ 62	neutral	I use my iPod all the time.
308_ 1	positive	While it didn't have all the features I would have liked, it was better than anything else I could find at the time.
195_ 17	positive	Another good feature is that you can charge the battery by just connecting the player to your computer using the USB cable.
225_ 46	neutral	It's an admitted design flaw that the people at Creative have acknowledged (google it).
132_ 127	negative	In addition, I do not think the battery lasts much more than eight to ten hours, and it can take four hours for a full charge.
233_ 26	positive	The use of 65536 (16bit) colors ensures you get your share of animations and icons on your phone
122_ 5	neutral	I cut 30-50 raised panel doors a month using every specie of wood imaginable.
132_ 417	neutral	  Buy the 20GB instead of the Mini
3_ 19	neutral	Really dissapointing. If you are inside, you can't be any farther away then 10 feet in a lit room.
299_ 17	neutral	Maybe it's time to explore McAfee products again...
5_ 10	negative	3) The lack of an intermediate resolution setting, as other reviewers have suggested, is a problem, but that problem is meaningless with a larger CompactFlash memory card
128_ 9	neutral	After getting it installed (which wasn't an easy task), it makes fine adjustments easy.
268_ 21	negative	This is somewhat annoying, but from working with computers (espcially windows -- ugh...)
183_ 30	negative	) Creative, Inc. the maker includes the barest of the bare minimum in the box, then through gross profiteering nickles and dimes you on EVERY single accessory at extraordinarily inflated prices.
163_ 4	neutral	Interestingly, they upgraded from 200 MHz to 216 MHz processors from version 3.0 to 3.1 and then throttled back to 200 MHz at version 4.0.
189_ 8	negative	The Creative MediaSource software that comes with the Zen Micro is cluttered, and excludes my favorite feature in iTunes, the ability to automatically copy everything you import into a certain folder.
6_ 0	positive	This wonderfully small digital camera produces fantastically good pictures printed on any decent photo-quality printer (with photo quality paper).
139_ 12	neutral	Because of that, a bunch of really smart people sat down and figured out how to make the Linksys WRT54G run their own custom firmware.
132_ 316	neutral	.  But the iPod itself is totally flawless as far as I'm concerned, and the best MP3 player on the market.
144_ 10	neutral	I w!
237_ 0	negative	who in the hell needs a frigging *VGA* camera on their CELLPHONE???
71_ 10	neutral	I'm beginning to think that the main reason Genie's so popular is their cutesy name.
313_ 2	neutral	THEN all of a sudden when I restarted my pc, I couldn't get to anything in IE.
132_ 297	neutral	 As mentioned above, accessing songs is simultaneously easy and fun.
151_ 2	positive	The new router came with an updated setup utility that makes getting the router installed a fairly straight forward process.
132_ 513	neutral	 I have no clue why this happens, as they show up perfectly in my iTunes library and there was no interruption during the uploads.
132_ 307	positive	  20 GB OR 40 GB?  The pros of the 40 GB: Comes with a "dock station" and double storage space (10,000 songs).
117_ 9	positive	The setup works awesome, as with any tool I look closely at the individual tool for it's merits, and not just the company as a whole.
298_ 17	neutral	If SystemWorks 2005 starts to act up, I'm done with Norton products forever.
233_ 33	neutral	I wouldn't do that because it's not worth my life.
138_ 7	neutral	If I did not know anything about networking whatsoever, I might be stumped at this point.
224_ 11	negative	It's too bad, though, that !
163_ 6	neutral	Someone in Cisco should post a review here letting us know why this was done.
0_ 181	negative	The buttons are rather stiff.
3_ 14	negative	Such a small zoom length that you would think that the zoom would be silent since it hardly zooms in...wrong!
240_ 8	neutral	What's wrong with it?
179_ 9	neutral	d be in the same IP range and see each other.
110_ 14	positive	The total price with delivery (free shipping ) was $135 !
211_ 21	positive	White earbuds ( i replaced those with some shure headphones, big difference), a case, a stand, a clip (which doesn't really work), and a nice little zen micro bag.
89_ 16	negative	Also, for those that complain that the Diaper Champ isn't as effective as time passes, keep the following in mind: AS BABIES GET OLDER, THEIR DIETS CHANGES (aka SOLID FOODS!) AND SO DOES THE SMELL OF THEIR DIAPERS!
233_ 27	neutral	Besides the above mentioned Merits , the phone has decent ear volume and loudspeaker functionality.
166_ 71	neutral	They provide you with their network security as a part of the service, but for a price.
5_ 14	neutral	Canon says it's normal.
140_ 11	negative	Essentially, the CD included with the package is, for the most part, worthless.
306_ 12	neutral	I had to pay $29.95 just to go any further.
194_ 10	positive	The earbud headphones are really nice.
176_ 3	neutral	I have successfully used the additional Ethernet ports to add peripherals to my wireless networks.
136_ 11	neutral	The CD determined my internet connection, determined my system configuration, asked me a few questions, and bingo I was up and running.
186_ 3	neutral	I visited quite a few forums and while the iPod is a great player I was concerned with the battery life and the inability to change them without breaking open the case.
242_ 7	positive	APPLICATIONS: It has lots of applications and they work very well... when you eventually find where they are and they finally open.
67_ 7	neutral	A couple of tips to having a clean-smelling nursery even with the Champ: Double bagging- Get those diaper sacks you would use to dispose of diapers if you're in a place where you don't want to dump a dirty diaper, like in your friend's wastebasket or kitchen garbage.
70_ 3	positive	It's also easy to empty out.
195_ 13	neutral	I have two spare batteries (brought on ebay for 28 bucks each).
241_ 19	negative	I wouldn't use it for business purposes and hand one out to all my employees, because you tend to want a little more rugged a phone for that.
189_ 7	neutral	(iTunes being an exception of course).
213_ 17	neutral	simple mechanical buttons would probably work !
16_ 2	positive	It has one more resolution of 1024X768 and a "Normal" compression mode.  And, it has the 3X zoom.
136_ 28	neutral	Anyhow, just for reference, I am using a Dell Inspiron Notebook, hooked up to the broadband cable modem that was supplied by Comcast.
109_ 0	positive	This is an excellent router for the money.
225_ 38	neutral	I loved this thing.
225_ 55	neutral	I know what you are thinking.
129_ 0	neutral	I have owned this router for nearly five years.
189_ 20	positive	The battery is removable.
193_ 7	neutral	The player was large and bulky.
132_ 301	positive	Also included in the "games" section is the great music trivia option - which tests your skill at being able to quickly place your own songs.
93_ 0	positive	This is a GREAT product!
34_ 1	positive	Really like it, easy to use, great images, very intuitive, fits in my jacket pocket.
178_ 25	neutral	If you follow the directions to the letter though then you should be OK on the setup.
201_ 2	neutral	I have my reasons.
0_ 158	neutral	The CNET review does not give this camera the review it deserves.
179_ 20	positive	the WRT54G plus the HGA7T is a perfect solution if you need wireless coverage in a wider area or for a hard-walled house as was my case.
187_ 5	neutral	The player itself is tiny , it gets a bit bulky when you put it in the hardcase, which you need to do if you don't want to get scrathes on the back(its a nice looking back too ).
166_ 9	neutral	The reason is simple, one word, and "security".
206_ 12	positive	The menus are easy to scroll through; they are laid out naturally, and make sense.
179_ 19	neutral	In my oppinion,!
305_ 3	neutral	Sorry to hear about all the other folk's problems....makes me wonder why I'm NOT having any (I'm running Win XP as well).
102_ 0	neutral	I did my homework before buying my larger 3+hp router for my router table.
183_ 37	neutral	5.
225_ 17	negative	The included headphones suck, so get your own.
166_ 63	neutral	Even things like the downloaded files, and E-Mail attachments you do want to receive.
132_ 25	positive	  EASE OF USE/DESIGN: The iPod is a very easy to use MP3 player, and if you can't figure this out, you shouldn't even own one.
163_ 8	neutral	In the mean time, I'll buy a different ro!
296_ 1	negative	Now in October,2004, the firewall said I couldn't OK anymore software to use the internet because its full.
227_ 16	neutral	The player intelligently pre-buffers the next song.
209_ 24	neutral	2.
291_ 1	neutral	I followed the instructions to the letter.
191_ 20	neutral	I find myself listening to the radio a lot.
256_ 6	negative	The "movies" last about 5 seconds.
231_ 0	positive	I've had this beauty for nearly 2 months now and I truely love it.
36_ 2	neutral	You'll carry it with you every day.
132_ 192	neutral	 So dissapointing, however I am now just gonna assume it's gonna get pretty niceley scratched over the years and I'll just have to live with it... and i will buy a case for it tomorrow... I mean heck I intended to get the case tomorow anyway but now it feels like the thing might even scratch IN THE CASE.. Other than that I am super extied about this product... I will update the review later in a few days...
259_ 0	positive	This may be a really cool phone, but it's not worth it with T-Mobile.
132_ 337	neutral	  I use a great free program called ipod agent to do this.
166_ 4	negative	Unfortunately, Linksys does not write the best documentation.
132_ 401	neutral	I don't really intend to drop mine to find out.
192_ 17	negative	Overall, it does its basic function very well, but we expect more from the mp3 players today and the Zen Micro does not rise to the occassion.
133_ 4	neutral	That only happens every so often, but its not that big of a drawback really, just a little slower than usual.
73_ 8	neutral	Spraying down the inside of the container (and letting it air out) periodically definitely helps.
32_ 8	positive	I just went on a quick photo shoot in NYC's  Central Park today, and what a bunch of beautiful photos I took, if I do  say so myself (and I do!)
256_ 5	negative	My last simpler Nokia started right up and was immediately ready for use.
132_ 277	neutral	 This seems obvious but the flaw lies herein: the instruction booklet tells users to charge their iPods 2 - 4 hours before initial use.
194_ 6	positive	The menu is easy to use and understand.
142_ 4	neutral	I wrongly thought that it was the router.
194_ 17	positive	It's cheaper, holds more songs and is smaller.
113_ 6	positive	Combine this with the excellent price we got in the Gold Box, and I'm really happy.
104_ 2	neutral	I have hade such poor luck with other tools (a Bosch drill) made in Malasyia, that I could not see getting it.
0_ 41	neutral	You don't have a shutter or aperture priority mode...so the lack of a high speed program is a total dealbreaker for me.
225_ 34	positive	Oh, and another is the cool "halo" light that surrounds the touch pad, and light's up when you touch the screen, and how the light glows when the Zen is connected to the computer.
132_ 318	neutral	Would be FIVE STARS, except for MAJOR FLAW
307_ 14	neutral	Nice little racket they've got there.
183_ 27	neutral	Buy from another company and run from Creative, Inc.
249_ 5	neutral	I could go on and on---but I won't!
135_ 16	neutral	meone would just give me some instructions in plain English.
132_ 281	positive	The actual experience of USING the iPod is magnificent.
206_ 0	neutral	Every few years I crawl out into the electronic world, in search of a new MP3 player to replace the horribly inadequate one I currently own.
195_ 42	neutral	Tested with the same mp3 for benchmarking
132_ 236	neutral	  My only regret is that I bought the 20GB model, which is way too big for what I really need: I would have been better off with a smaller model of lower capacity.
270_ 10	positive	It also works just fine for international calls.
132_ 144	neutral	simply put somebody had already opened the box earlier!
189_ 31	neutral	5.
166_ 18	neutral	What does a router, access point, do to help prevent this?
190_ 30	neutral	player[-][s]However, this one makes an ipod sound like your old LP's, so even if you're a casual listener, I'd advise that you avoid the purchase of this product. Terrible.
86_ 3	negative	All in all, the Diaper Champ serves its purpose, but it does not live up to its good reviews.
189_ 30	positive	The back of the player is nice too, with water ripples inside the clear white coating.
175_ 10	neutral	Nothing came to mind.
306_ 17	negative	I did it and it was worse the second time around...unbelievable.
207_ 24	negative	The little bag it comes with is cheap and useless.
191_ 21	neutral	You have to be in an area with good reception, but where I live I can get most of my favorite stations quite well.
170_ 8	neutral	Also use Netstat on the Linksys website which helps in setting it up.
214_ 28	neutral	However, I am going to try the suggestion of changing the sensitivity to high and see if that solves the problem.
88_ 7	positive	It is a bit difficult to get the unit open (the advice to take it slowly is sound), but now that our son is walking and exploring, I consider this a positive attribute!
274_ 15	negative	5) Video recorder is of no use and one cannot record something useful in 10 seconds and it takes a while to send the same through the "Free picture and video messaging" offered by service provider.
50_ 1	neutral	Well wait no more!
132_ 90	neutral	 I think its the 21st century version of the wallet with little photos.
193_ 23	positive	Don't worry this player rocks.
100_ 9	positive	We don't have to worry about running out of refills with this diaper pail!
245_ 1	positive	It has everything I needed: bluetooth, infrared, support for MMC, camera, and a good operating system with lots of supporting software.
137_ 8	negative	Linksys is more costlier than others and is a home/consumer division of Cisco.
117_ 8	positive	I have less money invested in the router table and dual routers than I would have if I had purchased a single cheap reliant shaper.
19_ 0	positive	I got this camera for an unbelievably low price at amazon.
291_ 0	neutral	I had the best intentions when I bought this, I really did.
184_ 6	positive	Sound quality is great, fm tuner is fine, as is the recorder.
0_ 145	neutral	You will not be dissapointed!
236_ 2	neutral	I've gone from almost every Nokia phone since they were only known and operational in Europe.
224_ 1	negative	Unfortunately I was wrong.
132_ 323	neutral	  The only thing that protrudes slightly is the "hold" switch.
225_ 35	negative	But, the Creative Zen Micro is plagued by a serious, serious stupid and elemenatary design flaw, and I'm going to tell you what it is...But first, two more things about this piece of garbage that's so great and could've made it a potenial IPOD killer.
227_ 5	negative	I haven't seen any problems yet, but if you don't like to tinker a bit, this player can be a little challenging to set up.
291_ 2	neutral	But it caused more headaches than I could imagine.
154_ 11	positive	The transmission speed is also quite good, with pages loading very quickly.
68_ 5	positive	And the biggest plus is that you don't have to buy any expensive refills.
183_ 21	neutral	The recharge cord will do the job in a fraction of the time that the USB cable will hooked to your computer.
191_ 15	neutral	- Integration with Media Player.
170_ 3	positive	There seem to be fewer collisons and dropped packets as I read from the router logs than with my old Dlink router.
243_ 36	neutral	I suggested that it didn't make sense for me to send in the phone for repair if I thought Nokia would charge me $120 to repair it since I could get it done locally for $30.
313_ 0	neutral	I really liked the firewall.
136_ 31	neutral	They do supply instructions when using Windows ME, 98 etc, that includes one more step than XP.
207_ 18	negative	es, the interface took a little getting used to, but once I did, it's almost second nature now.
15_ 14	neutral	Tamrac makes a tiny pouch that is best for the camera.
298_ 0	neutral	This came PRELOADED on our new, 2.8Mz Pentium 4 256RAM computer.
0_ 91	negative	 battery life is not long enough IF and ONLY IF you take a lot of video clips and play it back on the camera a lot of times...the camera/battery gets a little bit warm too when you use it for a long time but it's normal.
93_ 10	neutral	Highly recommended!!!
32_ 15	neutral	One is  the lack of censorship of your photos -- time for some, uh, fashion  photography of your wife or girlfriend, if that's something you both would  enjoy!
195_ 40	neutral	Spare batteries incase  you need some extra hours without charging.
162_ 3	positive	Works pretty well.
255_ 12	positive	I love the features, the interface, the size (the screen is a delight), the camera (though I admit I'm not much of a camera user -- so just a toy for me), the internet connectivity, the quality, etc.
35_ 13	positive	The white-LED backlit LCD is very bright and crisp, even in sunlight, and relatively easy on the battery.
274_ 11	neutral	3) Phone is kinda heavy, but small in size.
194_ 15	positive	So far I have no complaints with this player.
263_ 10	neutral	I have used this wireless internet almost everywhere i travel and it works great.
190_ 9	neutral	So that's the one I bought.
274_ 10	negative	Sometimes when you press buttons, the menu appears after a second or two.
132_ 227	neutral	 I love my new iPod!
75_ 4	positive	Great product, easy to use, economical, effective, absolutly fabulous.
0_ 78	positive	you can take pictures seconds after you turn the camera on...literally!
140_ 4	negative	I tried the CD setup program without any luck.
223_ 14	positive	The extra Gb is just a bonus.
122_ 8	positive	The height adjustment works well- not perfect.
299_ 8	neutral	Before I managed to manually add the program file, I contacted Symantec support.
193_ 46	positive	I enjoy getting use to the touch pad.
234_ 6	negative	You'll do that because the keys are tightly packed in and your fingers will likely press two keys at once.
258_ 3	neutral	 The first shipment took such a long time, I had to cancel it.
218_ 6	neutral	And I gave my CD plyaers away in a garage sale.
243_ 19	neutral	Does all this sound technical?
223_ 0	neutral	I've been using iTunes for about a year now with the intention of eventually buying an iPod.
25_ 6	negative	My only complaint and the reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the on-camera controls aren't as intuitive as they should be.
142_ 1	neutral	A great service which I highly recommend.
148_ 4	neutral	I am not sure if this is still the case with lucent drivers.
270_ 5	positive	It fits comfortably in my hand and pocket.
265_ 12	positive	For those Mac OSX users out there, iSync works fairly well.
0_ 149	positive	The photo quality is amazing.
195_ 26	neutral	The player has great potential (ur experiance may differ based on your headphones).
170_ 10	negative	This is NOT a router I would suggest for a novice user, my old Dlink DI52!
132_ 43	positive	I have an ipod and it is a great buy.
32_ 9	positive	The camera is as easy to use as a point and  shoot, and with instant review on the LCD screen, you can retake any  flubbed shots on the spot.
205_ 3	neutral	Also, the latest version of the firmware seems to actual deliver (in fact, more than deliver) the 12 hour battery life the specifications claim.
211_ 19	neutral	I've programed WMP to throw a few favorites on there all the time and always put my new music (less than 3 months) on so I can listen to them in the gym.
241_ 7	positive	A decent camera phone for taking quick pictures, movies, and having general all around fun with.
68_ 4	positive	The diaper champ couldn't be easier to use.
194_ 0	neutral	I got my Zen Micro last week.
213_ 26	neutral	(linux geeks -> avoid the 2.x series that is aimed at windows media play!
183_ 8	neutral	This brings my review to one star!
232_ 6	positive	Using supplied s/w, you can transfer all addresses from a different nokia phone into it.
174_ 2	neutral	SOHO boxes don't give you a clue about who is one your network or what they are doing.
47_ 3	neutral	The results are superb...  both in print and over the computer.
159_ 1	negative	There is not a word about satellite issues in either the user guide or the "knowledge" database at linksys.com, and first tech support person I spoke with kept me on the phone for an hour, then gave me a web site address to consult--that turned out to be the one I'd already found during a search of my own.
268_ 29	negative	Some people have commented about the size and weight of the phone, and it has rightfully gotten the nick-name "the bar of soap" which, it really is.
91_ 13	negative	Also, diapers tend to stay in the middle, causing the pail to get backed up.
108_ 3	positive	The speed control is well designed and it works perfectly.
132_ 486	negative	Apple's iPod battery replacement service costs $100!
35_ 15	neutral	Buy at least two batteries and you'll never run out in the field.
176_ 7	positive	After upgrading the drivers and firmware a few times and e-mailing tech support for some setting tips it now works fine.
195_ 28	positive	I compared it to other CD players (Two models of Panasonic, Rio & samsung) and they were no way even near Zen Micro.
3_ 1	positive	It is amazingly small, it's hard to believe all that has been packed into this camera.
91_ 10	positive	The height is a more convenient reach than others, where you have to hunch over.
265_ 9	positive	Outside of the T-Mobile service area the phone seamlessly jumped onto AT&T Wireless and various other services where the T-Mobile service was unavailable.
85_ 0	neutral	We have both a Diaper Champ and a Diaper Genie.
284_ 1	negative	Sometimes a suite is not a good deal and all you get is a bundle of headaches.
170_ 2	positive	I am getting better speeds on all my web programs.
166_ 23	neutral	Since you are connecting a router in-between the cable modem and the internet, the Mac address must be copied because its what's recognized by the your network service provider to identify you on their network.
249_ 2	positive	This thing does everything but washes your dishes.
113_ 7	positive	I'm sure I don't use it to the degree of some of the other purchasers, but I really like it!
166_ 41	positive	Well Linksys was one of the original big players in the router industry.
0_ 100	neutral	i forgot to mention about the camera's design.
170_ 18	negative	 So-So 1. Customer Service - 6 calls Half were efficient other half were equally incompetent.
150_ 5	neutral	For effort free wireless network adaptors, use the linksys USB adaptor.
265_ 15	positive	With Bluetooth off the phone last almost twice as long.
274_ 3	positive	The good:  1) Large LCD screen, colorful display, good resolution.
274_ 0	neutral	I bought 2 of these Nokia 6600 phones recently, thru the amazon market place.
54_ 4	neutral	And after about two months it just sat there in the corner of her room and was never used.
170_ 11	neutral	4 was much more easier to setup but had slower speeds and not as configurable as this.
195_ 38	neutral	Stuff you may need to buy: Wired remote from creative.
172_ 2	positive	Works perfectly with my netgear wireless PCMCIA.
223_ 7	neutral	As for the problem with locking up mentioned in a previous post, it only seems to happen if the USB cable is unplugged while WMP 10 is still running.
0_ 101	positive	if you haven't noticed, they designed it so that you can also take vertical pictures when you do the self-timer.
296_ 0	neutral	I have had Norton Internet Security for 3 yrs and up graded to 2004 versionin August 2004.
279_ 1	positive	Supporting an operating system, Symbian OS, you can download and run a lot of programs on this phone.
123_ 1	negative	The depth adjustment was sloppy.
323_ 4	neutral	I did remove all remnants of McAfee before installing and confirmed the Windows XP firewall was off.
136_ 34	neutral	It is easy.
211_ 9	positive	The Zen Micro (mine's black) has a lot going for it.
107_ 7	neutral	The router is also equipped with an adapter that accepts PC guide bushings.
100_ 0	neutral	Don't listen to the bad reviews!
323_ 8	neutral	I'm not sure how it would have been compromised by a virus.
268_ 23	neutral	On average, I prolly restart the phone every two days.
203_ 0	negative	Still has terrible software.
242_ 41	neutral	In my humble opinion, games, along w/ 'flip phones' belong in the hands of teenagers.
185_ 8	neutral	I also think that if you are going to offer them in different colors then commit all the way and have the entire device in that color, not just the front and color the head phones as well.
236_ 0	neutral	Don't get me wrong.
132_ 470	neutral	 The only area I wish Apple had improved upon would be the screen.
81_ 0	neutral	When my wife and I got the Diaper Champ, we thought that it would work perfectly.
88_ 1	positive	It sits in the corner of our bathroom and we have never had any problems with odors at all (and we live in the damp and humid South, where odors of all kinds are generally rife).
0_ 226	neutral	Huh? I missed out on lots of photos and lots and lots came back blurry.
127_ 0	positive	I have been impressed with the power of the Hitachi M12V.
132_ 269	negative	 Also, some other MP3 players such as the Nitrus allow you to play WMA (Windows Media Audio) files, whereas the iPod does NOT.
211_ 15	neutral	My ONLY complaint is that when i first received it, it was a little buggy.
199_ 2	neutral	When I finally couldn't take it anymore, I decided to pull the trigger on the Zen Micro.
320_ 1	neutral	First, I turned off my cable modem.
0_ 194	positive	Neat feature for self-timer allows you to record two different warnings.
132_ 154	neutral	I bought my IPOD roughly six months ago, and I've been pretty disappointed so far.
193_ 20	neutral	To bad Napster software is not compatible with Apple IPod's.
271_ 1	positive	The Nokia 660 runs the Symbian OS, which works pretty well for most standard phone fare, most of the stuff is not that intuitive, but if you actually learn how to use it all, there's plenty of neat tie-ins.
201_ 32	positive	- Audio Formats: supports both MP3, WMA... And yeah, WAV too.
207_ 26	neutral	I threw it away.
193_ 32	neutral	It has Apple insipid written all over it.
205_ 2	positive	I've had almost no problems with the firmware (ie, lock-ups, shut-downs etc), but I have kept the player up to date.
138_ 2	neutral	The new wireless router contained large warnings to run the CD first before trying to connect it.
132_ 378	positive	So reliability is the winner here for the iPod.
151_ 5	neutral	I used Linksys technical support several times.
209_ 17	positive	The player is smaller than you think.
31_ 10	negative	When taking pictures of people, however, it shows EVERY flaw in the subject's skin.
258_ 0	neutral	According to a survey, more customers are ordering their cell phone and service from AMAZON.COM
136_ 4	neutral	They strongly recommended that you use the CD rather than manually configure, and they were right.
20_ 1	positive	I would recommend this camera unequivocally!
190_ 26	neutral	Otherwise, you should get an ipod.
277_ 0	positive	I got this phone yesterday and didn't find any problems with it yet.
106_ 13	neutral	Lefties can switch the angle of the handles by loosening the screws, repositioning, then retightening.
169_ 1	neutral	It is attached to my desktop a P4 at 2.6 Ghz running Win XP Home.
192_ 7	neutral	I waited for Creative's FM transmitter for a month, finally bought a Belkin Tunecast II, which is not great.
215_ 13	positive	An extra gig of room, FM radio, voice recorder, PIM applications with sync to Outlook.
100_ 7	positive	1.  The Diaper Champ doesn't require special refills that are expensive and hard to find!
99_ 4	positive	Well the Champ has survived it's first year with our son and it is great!!
110_ 10	positive	It is very easy to change bits without removing the router from the table and the shaft lock works great.
198_ 9	negative	I'm going to try to get a refund but considering all the hoops I jumped through (emails, downloads, reboots, a purge and another download, plus reading through the help menu) a refund should be twice as frustrating.
100_ 4	neutral	Originally with my son we had a Diaper Genie.
29_ 0	positive	I purchased this camera before it went on sale, and while I wouldn't have minded keeping the extra $$$, it was definitely worth it.
132_ 178	neutral	 The box comes with iPod, ear buds, iTunes and iPod software, USB 2.0 and FireWire cables, and a home charger.
242_ 12	negative	The phone does not have an Mp3-player, FM radio, 200k+ color screen, megapixel camera, quad band, PDA, photo editor.
193_ 6	neutral	This player is not compatible with Napster To Go.
190_ 3	neutral	On the one hand, you have the ability to store and plays over 1000 songs on one little piece of machine.
298_ 18	neutral	But I don't think SystemWorks 2005 will start acting up.
132_ 510	neutral	  Of course, once the songs are converted, you don't have to worry with them again.
117_ 5	positive	The design of the collets is excellent and far exceeds any of the craftman (toy/junk) routers I have previously purchased.
95_ 1	neutral	But just to let you know that I've been breastfeeding and the poop doesn't stink as much as formula poop.
298_ 19	neutral	72 hours later after installing, it started doing the exact same things!
146_ 14	positive	The quality is significant and you'll be very happy from saving time and the headache.
35_ 4	positive	The lens retracts and has its own metal cover so you don't need to fuss with a lens cap.
217_ 13	neutral	Today, the Creative Zen Micro proves it, too, gets it right.
268_ 7	neutral	On a DELL Inspiron 8200 with a P4 2.0ghz system with 1gb RAM.
182_ 1	positive	what a kick butt Mp3 machine and the freedom to get songs from a reasonable source, instead of paying for them two or three times, then get the Creative Zen IPOD killer, kiss my ass Itunes!
225_ 60	negative	The flaw is in the circuit board that the headphone jack is connected to.
124_ 2	neutral	Unfortunately, the Bosch fixed base has no flat edge to ride against a guide, and both bases have a sub-base that extends past the metal base to prevent using against any kind of guide.
166_ 3	neutral	Yes, that makes women capable of installing these, there's no heavy lifting involved, just some focused thought.
223_ 12	negative	I would give it about 6 or 7 hours, although it will probably get better after a few charge cycles.
71_ 5	positive	Being a very economical person, I appreciate the fact that any plastic bag can be used with this system- I never did like the prospect of buying special Diaper Genie refills.
8_ 0	positive	FYI, Battery doesn't die if you don't use LCD
194_ 14	positive	It's faster than WMP.
150_ 0	negative	I couldn't get the install wizard to work.
132_ 172	neutral	You can use it to listen to music or audio books, either downloaded via the internet or added to your music library using your CD drive.
35_ 22	neutral	It's a little jewel.
185_ 10	neutral	Apple is Apple.
270_ 1	positive	It offers way more features than I need but the ones I use work well.
0_ 192	positive	I upgraded from a very small 3.2 mpxl camera to this camera with great results.
311_ 0	negative	I downloaded this set from Norton, and within minutes my Internet connection failed and my PC was almost dead due to registry problems from the download.
286_ 1	negative	Norton Internet Security 2004 is one of the more buggy implementations.
195_ 8	negative	The scrol bar agian takes some getting used to.
49_ 3	neutral	I would recommend getting a larger Compact Flash card, because once you start taking pictures, you won't want to stop.
186_ 15	positive	Overall I'm incredibly impressed with my new Zen Touch.
225_ 5	neutral	I wanted something that looked at least almost as good as an Ipod.
132_ 465	neutral	 The second battery charge lasted over twelve hours.
68_ 3	neutral	We all hated it.
201_ 13	positive	Moving on to sound department... It delivers!
268_ 1	negative	I purchased this phone after researching many different phones, mostly Nokia's that were T-Mobile compatiable.
0_ 170	neutral	Great for 1st time digital camera owners who are learning the "digital" way of the photo taking force (like me) or for the experienced digital photographer who wants a powerful, easy to keep with you at all times camera.
174_ 12	neutral	ID on their router.
91_ 11	positive	Its stable, so a curious toddler can't easily tip it over.
55_ 1	positive	I love that you don't have to purchase expensive refills.
205_ 12	negative	They are sensitive and accurate (perhaps too accurate, it senses through t-shirt cloth, but the touchpad can be locked), but easy to clean, unlike buttons.
242_ 0	negative	OPERATION: It's like BMW's I-Drive - It does it's job, but has the most unintuitive, overly-layered interface.
181_ 8	positive	All of this said [as it's on it's way back to Amazon], the one song it did include provided far better sound than the IPOD.
199_ 3	positive	The extra GB of hardrive space, removeable battery and FM tuner, as well as the fact that I was previously a satisfied owner of the Nomad II put it over the top for me.
323_ 0	neutral	I originally bought McAfee VirusScan 7 from Amazon.
223_ 17	positive	If your looking for a great sounding mini player, you can't go wrong with the Zen Micro.
178_ 10	neutral	Somehow the adap
15_ 5	negative	The viewfinder does not accurately represent the pucture being taken.
36_ 18	negative	Buttons size is OK for me, my wife, but not my grany.
1_ 6	negative	Other than that pictures taken in the dark are not as nice as I'd like them,
207_ 2	neutral	I loaded my whole CD collection on it and took it everywhere, even at work.
133_ 5	positive	It really is a great buy if you are lookin at having just one modem but many computers around the house.
123_ 6	neutral	It felt rather stable in my hands (heavy though.)
81_ 4	negative	We also had a problem with diaper wipes getting caught when the top was flipped.
298_ 27	neutral	HMMMM.. Good luck.
132_ 349	neutral	 I had initially been planning on buying this or another Apple product, but since decided to buy a player made by a different manufacturer.
123_ 0	negative	This router was a huge disapointment.
132_ 64	neutral	The problem with my iPod.
132_ 362	neutral	 Be sure you test this first to see if it does feel intuitive for you, rather than just going on the fact that it does sound pretty neat.
132_ 75	neutral	I had ordered a customized one from Apple.com, so I couldn't exchange it.
106_ 4	neutral	I bobbled a bit at the end of a couple of the cuts because the momentum of the charging M12V was a bit more than I was prepared for.
264_ 0	positive	The phone itself is pretty nice.
112_ 3	neutral	In the last 8 years since then I have done a ton of routing and have messed around with a bunch of different machines.
289_ 5	neutral	Plus, when Norton provided online updates, there were so many unexplained categories (about 15 over and above virus definitions)
110_ 3	neutral	I have 3 Bosch routers, 1 Porter Cable, and the large Freud.
132_ 119	negative	The battery issue is superficially a concern, but any reasonable solder-jockey (such as myself :-) can pop in a new one when the time comes (based upon the plentiful info gained from a google for 'ipod battery replacement').
108_ 8	neutral	There are a few points of contention which I have.
243_ 25	neutral	I spent over an hour talking to a tier-2 technician who told me that their tier-1 technician should have known that it was not possible to backup the 6600 to the 3650 safely in any condition.
132_ 69	positive	Thank you Apple!  You make fabulous products.
193_ 38	positive	I was more excited about this player upon opening than I was about the Nomad.
209_ 29	positive	Bottom line: If you value excellent sound quality and the ability to use music subscription services, and are willing to deal with the possibility (not the certainty) of setup gremlins, by all means get the Zen Micro.
205_ 9	positive	Its just as fast as the included Creative software, but much less invasive, and overall better looking.
320_ 3	neutral	I used "Add/Remove Programs" to unistall NIS 2003.
247_ 0	positive	this is a great phone i have this phone since Feb 04 and i never have any problem at all.
214_ 4	neutral	So I went to www.playforsure.com to see what devices were compatible with various downloading services.
195_ 3	neutral	Remember mp3 format lets you store tons of songs.
126_ 1	positive	The Hitachi M12V is a dream to work with, smooth starts, adjustable speeds, micro-adjustable depth, and plenty of power to spare.
265_ 6	positive	I did notice if you turn the phone on and off the OS takes a bit to load up and initially the menus are slower but once the phone has been on and booted up the menus are reasonably quicker.
132_ 434	neutral	No more Cds and your cd player getting broken when you step on it in your car or any other place
211_ 23	neutral	To me, currently at $218, this player is a!
181_ 4	negative	SO, YOU MIGHT INQUIRE, WHY DON'T THEY MAKE IT A FIRST PRIORITY TO CAREFULLY, SIMPLY EXPLAIN HOW DOWNLOAD MUSIC FROM YOUR MUSIC LIBRARY TO THEIR DEVICE??? This seems academic to me.
3_ 22	negative	To make matters work, there is no manual override to overcome this problem.
220_ 4	positive	The device looks very cool, I think (exactly as the photos promise), it's comfortable and lightweight in my jacket pocket, and the interface and controls are easy enough to navigate after a bit of practice.
78_ 0	negative	But now that she is eating solids the odor is escaping out and we are constantly using airfreshner.
209_ 9	neutral	That said, you can get more of what the Zen is capable of by donating them to your local iPod person (they're white) and getting a pair of $60-$80 aftermarket headphones.
134_ 16	neutral	It just doesn't follow through in any consumer-tested way.
249_ 1	neutral	One minute with the salesman and I was sold.
205_ 19	positive	I've dropped the device several times onto hard surfaces, and it still works flawlessly.
285_ 2	positive	Perhaps Semantic could work out the efficiency a little, but these reviews are highly exagerated... I would ask what else these people are running on their computers(?)
166_ 44	positive	ying to point out they have experience, and so the reliability of the connection you get is among the best.
100_ 25	positive	5.  The price is right.
276_ 3	positive	putting in MP3 player, lots of games and application to download.
312_ 1	negative	If you are already using a previous version of nortron security and unistalled it to install the new version, you will still have all kind of problems in installing the new version on your system!
173_ 4	neutral	But everything worked out for the best.
287_ 40	negative	Personally, I may never buy Symantect products again.
210_ 8	negative	his is what I get for my $200 on this MP3 player?
211_ 17	neutral	over and over again.
31_ 14	negative	I will also say that it takes a very long moment for the camera to do its digital image processing between the time you press the button and when the camera actually takes the picture.
135_ 21	negative	* I'm giving it 4 stars because the setup process was so miserable.
170_ 15	neutral	The UPnP and NAT traversal features have some kinks that will be hopefully fixed in the later versions of the firmware.
132_ 131	positive	 I have about 6 gb used on my iPod so far (well over 1000 songs), and as far as I can tell, all of them play at near-cd quality.
287_ 16	negative	Back in May 2004, when I first reviewed this, it had taken me over 16 hours to install and run.
268_ 14	positive	Which is really nice because you can get pretty much any piece of music in MIDI format for free on the net.
132_ 3	negative	 There isn't much features on the iPod at all, except games.
242_ 40	negative	Don't use them, so I delete them for addtl space.
0_ 217	neutral	that u missed in the mirror!
231_ 2	negative	Mine generally requires a charege every 48 hours or so and I don't really talk on it that much.
183_ 20	neutral	If you want to recharge it, you MUST connect it to your computer.
204_ 2	positive	It also has a voice recorder and FM radio that you can only get on an Ipod if you but an adapter seperately.
3_ 11	neutral	The longest I've had it work was about 1 hour and 45 minutes.
189_ 11	negative	NAGATIVES of the Player itself:  You need to do a little work before having full enjoyement of this player.
323_ 3	positive	I did not have any of the installation problems that people highlighted here.
166_ 42	neutral	Linksys is made by Cisco, the networking giant who introduced the first routers for the Internet, and became a company that rivals Microsoft in size.
0_ 191	positive	I found best results in most situation with manual/center auto focus, manual mode, ISO 100 (shorter aperture-time, so more often sharper images as with ISO 50), auto white balance (auto white balance is better than of the other canon cameras I have and they already do very-well).
299_ 6	negative	Seems the "program scan" feature did NOT find the EXE file for Outlook!
311_ 2	neutral	I lost all my personal info.
252_ 1	positive	I never had a single problem.
221_ 15	positive	Tough as nails.
174_ 8	neutral	BEST SECURITY PRACTICES I RECOMMEND...  Pick a UNIQUE SSID.
174_ 11	neutral	If you leave it as LINKSYS you will have to wipe out your config to connect to someone else's LNKSYS router cause they didn't change the default SS!
243_ 9	neutral	So I bought the phone and went on my merry way.
317_ 2	neutral	The Antivirus is good, but "Internet Security" just isn't worth it.
15_ 6	neutral	The LCD should be used.
250_ 13	neutral	You have to use speaker or handsfree, to get larger volume.
0_ 70	positive	Glad to see the Ed. revised the previous statements regarding image quality.
131_ 5	neutral	I use it on woods from the hardest of maples & osage to cedars.
197_ 4	neutral	In fact, it's much better than the iPod in that regard.
310_ 3	positive	And the firewall came with a wizard which made it effortless to configure it to my LAN.
195_ 36	negative	What I dont like: Nothing much except Headphones, Belt clip design.
214_ 0	neutral	I have been researching MP3 players for the last two weeks.
240_ 0	positive	This one has a good looking.
320_ 0	positive	PIII 1Ghz 512MB RDRAM Windows XP Pro 80GB HD  I was able to Uninstall NIS 2003 and Install NIS 2004 with no trouble.
208_ 13	negative	Also, the earbuds that came with it sound great but are uncomfortable (although my wife didn't have a problem), so I bought a pair of over-the-ear headphones.
228_ 1	neutral	I have visited multiple websites, and for virtually EVERY new hard-drive-based mp3 player I find, there are always user reviews that smash the new player and say something like "Just go buy an Ipod!"
311_ 1	neutral	I was forced to re-format the next day due to extensive incapatability issues.
132_ 117	positive	Versatile and stylish.
134_ 15	negative	The box proudly displays "SecureEasySetup (TM)" "Wireless Made Simple" "One Touch Setup Button" "Easy Start" "Easy Security" "Easy Everyday"   Apparently Linksys/Cisco knows that ease of setup is crucial.
103_ 6	neutral	The Hitachi is a great router for a great price, but only get it if you need the maximum power, variable speed and use it in a table.
89_ 6	positive	In fact, people who have been present while I changed my almost 3 month old son's diaper have been amazed at how the very 'potent' smell of the dirty diaper seems to disappear once I dispose of the diaper in the Diaper Champ.
241_ 10	positive	4) One nice thing about Nokias is that they have a ton of ring tone and game choices.
111_ 8	neutral	Unlike my experience with the Dewalt, I now enjoy reaching for the Hitachi (and allow me to stress I am a fan of many other Dewalt tools -- especially their large table saw and famous miter saws).
132_ 452	positive	I found that to be the most impressive thing about the iPod 'mini' - basically for ease of use, and the feel it gives.
242_ 36	positive	Remember, this phone uses an operating system - Symbian... and it's feature-rich w/ 65k colors.
290_ 8	positive	Both the antivirus and firewall are integrated into one piece of software and they update together.
324_ 0	negative	I have a modern PC with lots of speed and memory, but this firewall just brought it to a halt.
11_ 2	positive	It's overkill for simple snapshots, unless you've got way too much money to blow.
220_ 17	neutral	To use a bas!
315_ 0	positive	The product has worked perfectly for me on my XP.
278_ 1	positive	Aside from a 6MB++ built-in phone memory, there's a 32MB MMC card that goes with it!
132_ 381	neutral	But all you need to do is convert the files (besides mp3s are larger and better quality files than wmas) using a wide range of convertors, my favourite is the dBPowerAmp Music Coverter which also allows you to burn directly from cd to hardrive in mp3 format unlike Media Player.
110_ 4	neutral	I have many others in the past.
0_ 51	neutral	Tried multiple cards both fast and slow speeds and different batteries.
243_ 4	neutral	The 3650--being essentially a mini-computer--had memory leaks and occassional crashing, but nothing that a quick power cycle couldn't help.
31_ 13	negative	Other cameras taking pics of the same subjects turn out looking much better.
106_ 11	neutral	Not included are: - 3/8" chuck sleeve (the least common bit size) - depth scale in mm (the included one is in inches) - dust collector set - trimmer guide for chamfering
108_ 13	negative	Also, the fit and finish could be better although this doesn't detract from performance.
132_ 438	positive	 They fix the problem and help you with whatever your I-Pod needs Comes with two USB ports and a charger.
225_ 9	neutral	You can compress the files for more storage space before you start the transfer.
129_ 7	neutral	I bypassed the speed control, which was easy to do, now it works again, but with no speed control.
289_ 4	neutral	I may not be a computer expert but I am perfectly capable of following detailed instructions, and Norton just makes life way too hard.
117_ 10	neutral	I say this because I am not particulary fond of the hitachi compound miter saw.
183_ 26	neutral	What is up with nickle and dimeing consumers on the recharge cord?
0_ 110	positive	This camera takes amazing pictures and its size cannot be beat.
107_ 0	positive	This is truly a Clydesdale among the industry 3HP+ router workhorses.
132_ 478	neutral	I Love My iPod!
284_ 0	negative	Too bad the product is cumbersome and intertwined trying to do so much at one time.
114_ 2	positive	It came with a good fence that  is simple yet precise and thats well made and won't break.
155_ 4	positive	All in all, it's a good router if you don't have the cash for a Speedbooster one.
242_ 32	positive	The latter will provide better coverage in more remote areas of The States but still operates in many countries, excluding New Zealand and Australia.
315_ 3	neutral	I have XP with 256MB RAM, 40GB memory.
150_ 2	positive	It's easy to install the security on this product but Linksys doesn't do a good job of explaining why its important.
70_ 0	positive	Diaper Champ is by far the best diaper pail!
207_ 14	positive	I have ripped over 100 songs from my CD collection and it was so easy and fast, and they all sound great.
242_ 14	positive	DEPENDABILITY: I've seen no glitches.
256_ 7	negative	I mean, they're short!
0_ 142	positive	The flash is surprisingly good and even the video quality is excellent.
312_ 7	negative	What dissapointes me the most that a software like that  is not cheap gets zero support form symantec, if you want support, they'll charge you a Fee!
189_ 9	neutral	I like to keep all of my Mp3s in one folder and manually doing this is a pain.
216_ 2	negative	The Touchpad is virtually unusable -- sometimes you have to press like mad to make a selection and other times the slightest brush causes something to be selected that you don't want.
225_ 14	positive	Other mp3 players won't give you the sonic clarity of the Zen at this compression level, so I imagine they won't at lower ones, either.
132_ 359	neutral	 I strongly suggest anyone considering an iPod test it out first to see how they like it.
11_ 4	positive	Slow-syncro flash, macro/infinity mode, etc.
106_ 16	negative	Not so nice things: - a bit too much weight and power for easy handheld use - spindle lock makes for awkward bit changing (outside of a table) - the 1/4" chuck sleeve requires MUCH tightening to keep bits from slipping
211_ 0	positive	The Zen Micro is near perfect.
79_ 4	positive	1) The champ is easy to use.
299_ 15	neutral	I use the program like most other people - in DISABLED mode.
3_ 12	negative	This isn't uncommon in cameras, though, just as long as you bring your charger and spare batteries, you should be fine.
166_ 45	neutral	You typically find less horror stories detailing poor connections with this, and most Linksys models.
132_ 467	positive	I was worried about what the sound quality would be like, but that seems to be just as good as the actual CD sound.
193_ 0	neutral	I first signed up for Napster on line.
132_ 379	neutral	  As far as an actual player is concerned, the iPod is next to none.
178_ 1	neutral	For the last couple of years I'd run the Linksys Wireless B router; it was rock solid, no issues whatsoever.
32_ 1	neutral	I've owned a few 35mm cameras over the years, including one SLR and two point & shoots.
193_ 54	neutral	I believe them.
132_ 377	neutral	Both from unspecialist makes, and in Creatives case a company that deals mostly in computer parts, and has not invested the money that Apple has.
17_ 3	negative	The Adobe software also was wonderful in 98 but it will not let you print correctly with XP so you are forced to create your document then either print it from Windows or export it to another application.
275_ 3	negative	so, right out of the box i had issue.
132_ 38	neutral	Maybe in their 5th generation they'll add features to the iPod. But for now, pleases don't buy this, and buy a Creative Zen or the iRiver H10-20GB instead.
255_ 8	positive	All at the same time, and all without a hitch.
208_ 10	neutral	The slow throbbing glow that it emits during charging is cool too.
287_ 10	negative	They are a royal pain to install, and don't function properly once finally installed -- if you can install them at all.
105_ 0	negative	It ain't cutting edge (no pun intended) state of the art with all the latest bells & whistles & it definitely ain't pretty.
189_ 29	neutral	The photos don't do it justice.
124_ 1	neutral	I also have the very popular Bosch 1617EVSPK kit and had planned to use it on my cabinets, routing dados for shelves.
31_ 2	neutral	I put a 128MB CF card in it.
306_ 8	negative	Then, my ad/pop-up blocking was completely gone.
215_ 9	negative	I've read about the issues with the scroll bar, but they must have taken care of that now.
132_ 114	neutral	The Gmini is like an iPod VIDEO, PHOTO, GAME, MUSIC, all into ONE and it is exactly the same size as the iPod...      and you can play any MP3 directly and fresh from the NET...     oh yeah, even audio books, anything!
187_ 2	positive	1 Speakers at home, I rarely use it with the earbuds, though they are much better than the ones you normally get with other mp3 players.
43_ 1	positive	The size is tiny, which I love.
122_ 3	neutral	I have 5 routers, I use them all!
229_ 1	neutral	(The others include: the Intel Pocket Concert, the Archos Jukebox, which was returned after three or four faulty units...I'm extremely patient, and the Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox 3.
210_ 0	neutral	I bought this item in part due to the good reviews here on Amazon.
0_ 84	positive	great video clip quality for a digital camera - so much better than my old one (Canon A60(?)...the 2.0 megapixel one).
162_ 4	neutral	Haven't had any of the issues I've been reading in the other reviews.
229_ 12	positive	These include: MP3, Wave, WMA, WMA Pro, and WMA Lossless; it is very user-friendly simply by right-clicking the file(s) to be converted.
106_ 7	neutral	I've cut dadoes, flush trim to duplicate a complex form, and done roundovers and Roman ogees.
103_ 3	positive	The Hitachi has plenty of power, runs smooth, and cuts effortlessly through maple (with Freud bits!)
166_ 2	neutral	You have a chance if you're a good cookbook recipe follower.
146_ 9	positive	The dual anteanna is a plus and the design is slick.
212_ 1	neutral	Comments such as "it's stylish" or "it looks cool" or "everyone has it" don't nesseseraly make something good.
251_ 14	negative	I'm an advocate of Nokia , but this phone and the following models (7610) , are seemingly a desperate trial at squeezing as much under-engineered and experimental technologies in one sloppy phone .
106_ 8	positive	The heavy motor and continuously variable speed control let this router churn through everything I threw at it.
0_ 126	neutral	My SD500 was kept in a case all the time if not being used.
0_ 127	negative	I took it out one day and the LCD was not working.
106_ 0	positive	Hitachi's M12V is a big beast of a router.
181_ 7	neutral	I just want MUSIC to eminate from it when I want, how I want.
306_ 18	neutral	I gave up.
132_ 474	neutral	You can adjust the time the backlight stays on (or turn it off completely), so it's only a minor issue.
298_ 29	neutral	I'll update my review if I find out otherwise.
190_ 8	neutral	The creative came with a free trial of [random file sharing company] "to go".
195_ 7	negative	PC software that comes with the player is not as simple as i Tunes but its not bad at all.
132_ 219	neutral	You might change the battery once before the iPod is superceded by something a lot better and less expensive.
135_ 20	neutral	I don't mind if the instructions are online instead of in the box, but please have some instructions *somewhere.
272_ 4	negative	The only downside I have found with this phone is that it is a bit slow to react, meaning when I push the contacts button, it takes a while to load, this is true for almost all the menus and programs on the phone.
266_ 0	positive	The nokia 6600 is a great phone, good games, good camera.
189_ 42	neutral	You can only copy songs you've downloaded for free or ripped from a CD.
132_ 232	negative	As a Windows user, I had to install the software including drivers and iTunes on my desktop, and this is the only area where I encountered a nuisance.
147_ 0	positive	I got it working fast enough.
210_ 1	negative	The machine itself seems fine, but the software that came with it is AWFUL.
267_ 3	positive	3. Play Java games on it.
297_ 2	negative	If you are new to the market and looking to buy a symantec software product, save yourself some money and buy the 2003 version.
0_ 103	positive	I bought this camera two days ago, and I'm very pleased to say that it has been worth the money.
166_ 47	neutral	Why the four-port wireless model you ask?
302_ 2	positive	Norton pops up a window about the intrusions and gives me as much detail as possible about where the intrusion is coming from.
175_ 9	neutral	I can't really think of any negatives, but I'll try okay.
132_ 289	positive	The included earphones are pretty good - my advice?
5_ 11	neutral	(I got a 64 meg card for $... and it holds 105 pics at 1600 x 1200 res).
193_ 21	neutral	Its my first purchase choice.
195_ 5	positive	User Interface: The software is simple and straight forward.
142_ 8	positive	I've since gotten the Linksys Modem (BEFCMU10) and stacked it with the WRT54G router and it works fantastic!!!
298_ 31	positive	By the way, I use the Norton 2003 Corporate at work with absolutely no trouble.
213_ 14	neutral	my initial reaction was to tap the up and down arrows, when in reality, you need to touch, maintain contact and slide your finger up and down.
40_ 0	neutral	I have a 35mm camera outfit that cost quite a bit of money a few years ago.
268_ 16	positive	The fact that you can assign ringtones to people and/or groups is really cool.
272_ 0	positive	I've had this phone for almost a year now and it has been nothing but great to use.
287_ 17	neutral	Since then, I have had one problem after another.
132_ 430	positive	 All the "cool" features of the mini, but with 20GB instead of 5.
173_ 2	neutral	Got the Linksys after reading some reviews.
265_ 2	positive	I was looking for a phone which synced with Mac OSX using Bluetooth, had decent battery life, could check email, had good reception, nice screen size and was durable (I break often break small gadgets)
285_ 1	positive	Sure, it slows it down a little, but that's expected.
206_ 22	neutral	I will be using the player 99% of the time as an MP3 device, so these small pauses are entirely bearable, for the added features just to be available.
79_ 5	neutral	One pail that I used was so difficult to change the bag and insert the dirty diaper.
234_ 9	negative	I've have many Nokia's and while this is the best for features, it's the worst as a phone.
209_ 8	positive	The supplied headphones are hands-down better than the mediocre iPod buds.
79_ 1	neutral	Having used it with 2 children 13 months apart.
217_ 6	neutral	What compels you to choose one over the other?
222_ 3	positive	The radio works excellent in my area, I'm not sure everywhere else.
212_ 17	neutral	he Pencil?
234_ 0	negative	I've had Nokia's for years, and while this one is packed with whiz bang features it is disappointing for its primary use - a phone.
0_ 36	neutral	This is a common problem with all ultra compacts, but I think I will probably go out and buy an external flash at some point.
0_ 169	positive	If you want a sharp looking, fast digital camera and you don't need or want manual controls, then this is the camera for you!
312_ 6	negative	If you have no previous version of  nortron security on your system, or Nortron Antivirus, the installation will go fine, otherwise dig in and in to do a major registery clean up!the old programs will leave a trace that will mess up the new installation, even if you uninstalled the old programs perfectly.
293_ 1	negative	This product is absolutely not ready for release.
132_ 180	neutral	For Mac owners, you'll need Mac OS X 10.1.5 or later (10.3.4 or later is recommended) and your machine must have the appropriate ports built-in.
87_ 0	positive	I got the diaper champ because of the great reviews as well as the fact that you can use regular garbage bags.
246_ 8	negative	All in all I would say wait for the cell phone companies to create a PDA/cell hybrid that is efficient and easy to use as a phone.
132_ 201	neutral	After hearing about the new Napster service for portable MP3 players, I was anxious to try it out.
32_ 3	neutral	This year, with a cruise to Nova Scotia coming in  August, I decided the time was right and just purchased a Canon S100  Digital Elph.
312_ 3	positive	Luckly,with 3 rebates this product will cost me nothing! it is indeed worth nothing.
134_ 17	neutral	I don't know if Netgear, D-Link, etc are any better.
217_ 15	neutral	This makes the Zen Micro the first choice for MP3 owners with a Windows-based system.
196_ 9	positive	About the product:  The Zen Micro is a sleek, stylish device that caters not just to "hip" youngsters but to people of all walks of life who like to listen on the go without having to worry frequently about battery life, size, or the "awkward" factor.
255_ 5	neutral	I've synched it with my PC over bluetooth.
142_ 7	neutral	,I finally figured out that the modem could not support the wireless router and it had a short, plus RCA no longer carried it and the thing was ugly, taking up space.
144_ 7	neutral	If you just use the router to surf the web, this router should serve your needs.
289_ 3	negative	And, when you think about it, it's insulting that Norton requires its customers to jump through these hoops -- anyone who can provide proof of purchase, whether on the phone or online (what if your computer is down?), should have equal priority.
132_ 164	negative	If you call apple and tell them your ipod has been damaged, they charge you roughly $105.50 per minute and blame you for "abusing" your ipod.
298_ 2	negative	Long reboots due to Norton taking FOREVER  to boot.
132_ 57	neutral	 The backlit screen of the iPod is also easy to read.
169_ 3	neutral	Even though the WET11 is a B standard I knew that this router would be compatiable and in the future I plan to link 2 other PC's too it .
22_ 0	neutral	I've been using this camera for a few months now.
31_ 6	positive	The camera is solid, performs well, takes good pictures, and the battery lasts pretty long if you disable the LCD viewfinder.
132_ 509	neutral	  It's the biggest pain in the rear end of all the cons, without a doubt.
213_ 1	positive	anyway, my wife got this for me for my birthday and I love the thing.
303_ 1	neutral	Not much recourse for the consumer in these cases.
120_ 2	positive	The first one lasted about 6 years of heavy use.
242_ 47	positive	A Sony Ericcson may be the phone for you... but good luck finding one w/ all the features & such a competitive price.
71_ 9	positive	This is a really great buy, for yourself or as a shower gift.
306_ 5	neutral	I also believe that when I renewed my subscription service that Symantec uploaded the NIS 2004 patch.
144_ 3	neutral	I use Apple iTunes to stream music to my stereo via the Linksys router.
178_ 18	neutral	First, the router was on sale for $49 at Circuit City.
132_ 10	neutral	This is really stupid to me. 18 months for a battery isn't good, actually, it's medicore.
223_ 1	neutral	That was before the Zen Micro came along.
60_ 1	positive	This is a MUST HAVE product for all new moms!
87_ 5	neutral	The reviews were definitely right.
166_ 7	neutral	It's not here yet!
187_ 19	neutral	Its not convinient to enter name of course but synchronise it with outlook and it becomes a gem of a address book.
1_ 3	negative	The only thing I don't like is the small size (8 MEG) memory card that comes with it.
37_ 0	negative	i researched and researched between getting the canon s20 or the canon s100, and of course i got the latter!
66_ 5	neutral	I did dump a little deoderizer tablet in it.
0_ 89	neutral	change the orientation to vertical and it will automatically change the time and date orientation too.
31_ 3	positive	First, I have to say that I have NEVER had the slightest problem with this camera or the software.
0_ 42	positive	All I have to say is that the pics I get with my SD500 are both rich and color and high in detail, the user interface is awesome, the battery charger is tiny and super light and SD cards are relatively cheap and getting cheaper all the time.
214_ 18	neutral	And within one hour I had downloaded , organized my play lists and was listening to the songs I downloaded.
71_ 0	neutral	My original purpose in buying the Diaper Champ instead of the Genie was to use it with cloth diapers.
137_ 10	neutral	Whatever you do, please don't go for a Netgear. !
187_ 25	negative	Second might be a problem I might have with my PC but not too sure, when the player is connected on the USB and I start playing on it and also using the windows explorer, it sometimes pauses by itself and tries to synchronise with the PC during play, which is a bit irritating.
189_ 17	neutral	Update the firmware which can be found on the Creative web site.
217_ 25	neutral	I do not work for Creative; I had a chance to play with a review copy in-depth, as others have (See Engadget, Gizmodo, or c|net as examples).
191_ 27	neutral	They seem to be working on a fix and will probably sort it out soon.
125_ 9	positive	It is without even a slight doubt, my new favorite.
245_ 0	positive	This phone is one of the best I've ever used.
132_ 203	neutral	 So it was not any surprise that I could not try out this new type of service.
79_ 19	positive	The Champ did not start letting a little odor through until well over a year.
258_ 4	neutral	The second one is on hold for almost 2 weeks with a message that "Can be delayed further".
318_ 5	positive	It works better and has more useful features than NIS 2003.
191_ 23	positive	With the right firmware, drag and drop to and from the player like any other jump drive.
201_ 19	negative	Although, I thought it could've been designed a bit better.
220_ 11	negative	The battery, as others have said, also seems weaker than Creative suggests.
170_ 4	negative	I had a lot of problems setting it up, since the software given along with it is buggy.
132_ 250	negative	  If there were any complaints I have, they are marginal, but one is Apples' properietary set-up for music files, their incompatibility with other music services (i.e. Napster) is down right wrong.
108_ 9	neutral	The depth scale is a joke and I wouldn't use it for anything but a "ball park" measure.
294_ 1	negative	It's a rip off if one buys Norton Internet Security and antivirus.
0_ 106	positive	If you on the other hand always use automatic settings (and not manual) you should be just fine, as the camera features some of the best automatic settings I have ever seen.
57_ 0	positive	There is no odor and extremely easy to use.
288_ 0	neutral	Antagonising
136_ 16	neutral	When I went into the living room, it went to very good instead of excellent, and gave me 37Mbps.
206_ 9	neutral	players that are currently available, but not the Zen Micro.
212_ 8	neutral	As for the warrenty, i havent seen it yet, but i fear for a short on!
287_ 33	negative	You also need to go in and MANUALLY remove many Symantec files from the REGISTRY.
322_ 0	neutral	I was begining to think I was computer-retarded after dealing with this program.
10_ 1	positive	I am very pleased with my purchase.
183_ 18	negative	) WORST FEATURE POSSIBLE, THIS ALONE MAKES IT RATE ONE STAR: What's up with no recharge cord?
68_ 0	positive	I bought this diaper pail when my son was just a few days old and I absolutely LOVE it!
132_ 315	neutral	 My ONLY complaint thus far is the process of downloading tracks to the iPod itself - the iTunes software is really a hassle, above all else the whole concept of WMA and the faulty built-in converter
117_ 4	neutral	My routers arrived promptly and I actually used one of them in the construction of the router table.
270_ 16	neutral	It seems to be a much more user friendly company than Verizon and a thousand percent better than the horrible Quest Wireless.
198_ 8	neutral	They responded -after I told them I have a Zen Micro and suggested that my "jukebox" needed to be purged.
154_ 6	neutral	Setting up the 2nd computer really was easy too -- basically hooking the computer to the router and!
36_ 14	neutral	Take shots at angles you thought you wouldn't.
161_ 1	negative	I was having intermittent problems with it losing connection.
112_ 4	positive	After getting used to the M12 all the rest seemed lacking.
0_ 26	positive	I've taken about hundred shot with the Canon, in varying lighting situations, all in auto mode, and not one blurry picture!!!
205_ 8	neutral	With the latest version (10), I can simply browse my WMP library, adding songs/albums/artists to the sync list, and then sync all of the tracks at any time.
132_ 489	neutral	If you look on Google or around the web's many search engines, you can find a site that will replace the battery at a cheaper price.
132_ 61	positive	 Battery life keeps improving on the iPod, and a new iPod will give you up to twelve hours of play time, per charge.
268_ 15	positive	You can use the OBEX File Transfer service with bluetooth from linux (KDE-bluetooth provieds a nice intergration into Konqueror for this) for sending files to the phone.
195_ 4	positive	I have stored 40 audio CDs and i still have close to 2.8 GB free.
4_ 0	neutral	I researched digital cameras for a month before purchasing the s100...
132_ 224	neutral	 I am a total iPod addict.
242_ 49	positive	Despite a critical start, this phone deserves four stars because it accomplishes what it sets out to do (which is pretty lofty)... does more than most... does it well... is dependable.
39_ 2	neutral	I added a second battery (about $69, recharges in about two hours) and a large (192Mb for less than $400) CF module.
28_ 5	neutral	End of story.
17_ 0	negative	I originally gave this camera 5 stars. When I had Windows 98 it was wonderful but I got a new computer last November with XP the usb software is Sooo... not compatible with XP
132_ 483	negative	 The only problem is the battery life.
268_ 9	positive	I have really enjoyed the camera on this phone.
166_ 11	neutral	cted Internet connection less than 20 minutes before someone will find its port address, and access it.
132_ 39	neutral	God Save Apple  I have been an Apple person since 1984, when I got my first Mac.
268_ 12	positive	I will also say that setting up the e-mail account was very simple and straight-forward, although you do need an external SMTP server to use.
142_ 5	neutral	Fool that I was!
138_ 21	negative	little to no networking experience, just in case the automatic CD method has issues.
114_ 7	positive	The router has plenty  of power for any type of bit or wood I need to cut, and the speed control  knob is easy to get to.
166_ 20	neutral	A Mac address is a unique hardware identifier.
191_ 26	neutral	Plus, from the Creative discussion forums it is clear that they have some problems with excessive battery drainage with the current firmware.
217_ 14	positive	Better for the Zen Micro is Outlook compatibility.
267_ 9	positive	Clear the call logs once in a while to speed up the phone people!!!
192_ 12	negative	- The outlook synch only works for non recurring appointments, which personally is very annoying to me but probably wont be to most people. -
241_ 16	negative	You will probably have to get a belt clip for it, however, unless you wear the pants with the cargo pockets.
257_ 2	positive	Ive had this phone for a year now - and its the best phone I have owned.
278_ 5	negative	T610 supports only midi files.
0_ 128	neutral	Who knows� maybe the service center did a sloppy job in fixing the camera the first time, that it is easily broken.
29_ 1	positive	I have been absolutely, completely satisfied with the product and its capabilities.

168_ 6	neutral	Speed is identical to my hard wire desktop direct cable modem connected PC.
140_ 6	neutral	Nope.
132_ 204	negative	Apple closed their island to anything that resembled Microsoft, and clearly let Napster know it could not use their products with Napster's services.

132_ 177	neutral	Both platforms work seamlessly with the iPod.
207_ 5	negative	After consulting with Creative's customer support, they determined that the hard drive was broken and the only recourse was to send it in for repair, which would cost me $40, since it's past the 90 day warranty (pretty short warranty).
166_ 31	neutral	You have to look to the Net, tech service help lines, and FAQ sites on your router, to find out how to solve most of the typical problems.
0_ 39	neutral	I expected more from a 7MP sensor and a Digic II processor.
214_ 15	neutral	There were two downloads I had to complete.

324_ 9	negative	I tried it again this morning and it said I didn't have the required "permissions" and lacked proper administrator status.
73_ 5	positive	(we wrap them nice and tight) *we use our regular kitchen trash bags--cheap!

132_ 120	positive	The controls and the menus are clearly displayed and easily fathomed

128_ 7	negative	The fine adustment knob which came with the router was very difficult to use on a router table.
132_ 264	neutral	 However, with the iPod you cannot.
223_ 11	negative	where close to 12 hours but at least it is replaceable (and they included a second one free).
225_ 6	neutral	I saw the Zen, and-BOOM-I bought one for me and one for a family member.
191_ 2	positive	Also, the WMA compression format is superior to MP3, especially at lower bit rates, so I needed a player that could handle WMA and integrate well with my Windows XP computers.
207_ 6	neutral	They said the repair could take weeks, and being impatient, I decided to just order another one, 1 day delivered from Amazon, and then I could have two, one for at work and one for at home.

0_ 144	positive	I'd be happy to talk to anyone about this camera.
298_ 34	neutral	Trust me and all the other reviews on this one.
132_ 241	negative	  My only complaint (really more of an observation) is that the outside finish of the iPod is rather delicate, so I am going to get a case for mine so it doesn't get all scratched up.
132_ 382	neutral	 It's well worth it, the mp3s do in fact sound better.
139_ 21	neutral	Do not use this thing without Wireless Encryption.
134_ 14	neutral	You have to completely exit the Wizard and re-start the CD in order to find the "User Guide" tab which loads the manual.
217_ 26	neutral	Just because Amazon doesn't have it to sell doesn't mean the product is unavailable for review.
66_ 0	negative	For my first I had a diaper genie which was not only costly with the refills but it was also very stinky.
0_ 34	neutral	Once I have the time, I plan to explore all the high end features of the camera, but for now, I can't comment intelligently or fairly.
132_ 16	negative	 Another thing you should know, the metal on the flip side of the iPod is very tacky, and scratches very easily.
134_ 6	neutral	These are just some of the pathetic examples.
205_ 1	positive	Overall, I've been very impressed with the player.
184_ 0	positive	Well, I have an Ipod mini - and I really like it, but all in all, I like the Zen Micro more.
132_ 453	neutral	It was worth the wait.
240_ 4	positive	The screen is quite big (between all handphone), but the just about 65000 color.
178_ 15	neutral	But my question: How does this CD make it out the door if it's this bad?
132_ 485	neutral	After a year, your battery is dead and you need to replace it with a new one.
79_ 7	neutral	For diaper disposal, you had to push a button and the lid would or would not pop open.
242_ 29	neutral	If you're still whining about storage, deleting some games will free-up still more memory.
0_ 25	neutral	WOW! Big difference!
233_ 39	neutral	When I purchased this phone , I thought to myself that I had purchased the most popular phone around and the thought didn't please me.
45_ 1	neutral	With the camera I also bought a 128MB compact flash card, an extra battery, and a carrying case.
214_ 32	neutral	:-)  www.zetazen.com
136_ 25	neutral	What is important is that your internet connection will never even approach the speed capabilities of this router, so don't hassle yourself with any concerns over varying connect speeds of the wireless network.
234_ 2	negative	On the plus side it's packed with features, including BlueTooth that works fine - it's really a tiny computer that is also a phone... and that's the negative.
68_ 7	neutral	I generally put kitchen size bags in it, but you can use just about any size if you are in a pinch.
132_ 514	neutral	 It's really no big deal to me, but is worth mentioning.
132_ 260	positive	For a sleeker, smaller and more "average" MP3 player the Nitrus is great but the iPod blows it out of the water - the interface is great and the design is wonderful.
64_ 0	neutral	We just had a baby and were debating getting either this product or the Diaper genie and this is what sold us on this product
69_ 5	neutral	I had no problem with stuck diapers and if I did it wasn't often but I can see how it would happen.

0_ 3	positive	The SD500 rivals the Canon G6 in image quality.
171_ 5	neutral	Do your research and buy something like netgear or dlink.
71_ 7	negative	As one other reviewer pointed out, it does occasionally take a little effort to push down the "plunger" to get the diapers in the pail, even though upon inspection the bag doesn't really look full.
190_ 16	negative	The headphone jack gave out after only a couple weeks of use, and the stock earbuds were replaced same day with some high end sony's I'd been having.
137_ 9	neutral	But I believe for stability, this extra price is worth spending.
132_ 73	neutral	 The chances of getting a flawed one is very small indeed.
132_ 439	positive	 They are EXTREMELY convient and you don't have to buy them seperately Has I-Tunes, which provides qulity music at low prices.
15_ 13	neutral	I take my camera everywhere.
81_ 3	negative	We resorted to using small plastic bags to store the dirty diapers and dumping them in a trash can and using the Diaper Champ for wet diapers only.
189_ 15	negative	Even on the LOW sensitivy level, a slight touch can skip or pause the track.
88_ 2	positive	It is easy to install and change the ordinary trash bags, easy to clean, and most important, easy to use one handed - just insert folded dirty diaper and flip the handle.
67_ 2	positive	The bags attach inside the Champ easily and all one has to do is cram the diaper down and flip the handle.
220_ 0	neutral	if not amazed, I won't go into the kind of detail many people have here, but I do want to say a few things about my experience so far (I've had it about two weeks) with the Zen Micro;
132_ 420	neutral	 I ordered the mini from amazon, and while waiting for it to arrive I wandered into the Apple store.
132_ 311	neutral	 I mean, for music buffs and archivists - use your PC as the archive, not the iPod!
299_ 2	negative	I am an advanced computer user, so I cannot even imagine how a new or novice user would ever get this terrible program to work!
132_ 395	neutral	 Mac is really big on streamlining everything (maybe that's why you never get a decent manual with any of their products).
79_ 9	positive	It was so easy my toddler would dispose of her on diapers.
34_ 0	neutral	got this as it flew off the shelves.
0_ 155	neutral	Highly recommended.
209_ 3	neutral	Now, there's nothing wrong with the Zen Micro a few months in beta testing wouldn't iron out.
253_ 7	negative	Among its weak points is the MMC slot location and a bit vague design.
132_ 87	neutral	I also have been using it as a USB device, which just tickles me no end.
306_ 16	neutral	They said to call back if it still didn't work after the complete uninstall.
134_ 3	negative	The Wizard is particularly sinister.
193_ 35	positive	Creative was defiantly giving the IPod a run for their money with this device.
178_ 0	neutral	First, let me set the stage by saying that I am not a network specialist, just a regular Joe who for convenience reasons wants a wireless network in his house.
170_ 0	positive	A decent peice of hardware with great speed (I get the same speeds as with my comp connected directly to the modem)  and good signal quality.
36_ 17	negative	8- Buttons are little, but If you have steady fingers and dealed with a casio wirst calculator watch, you can deal with almost anything.
287_ 27	negative	But this doesn't make up for it's innumerable other short-comings, the biggest of which is the inability to download any updates due to problems with LiveUpdate.
132_ 406	negative	 We can start by losing the shiny miracle-material cover that you can literally scratch just by looking at it wrong, and thus eliminate the need for third-party "iSkin" protective covers for an extra thirty bucks.
169_ 12	neutral	My Xbox is about 70ft and 3 walls away from the WRT54G.
191_ 11	positive	The blue backlight is pretty cool.
62_ 1	negative	The hole to put the diaper in needs to be larger as I am now using medium diapers (I have a 3 month old) and they're on the brink of being too large to fit no matter how compact I make then and how un-soiled they are.
135_ 25	positive	And it is EXTREMELY well-priced for what you're getting.
189_ 27	neutral	4.
193_ 13	neutral	The player was not very appealing either.
67_ 1	neutral	Well, I suppose this is better than an open pail, but to have a nursery in which there is no unpleasant smell is quite impossible no matter what you use.
81_ 1	neutral	We read the reviews on and saw that people liked it much better then the Diaper Genie, but I'm not 100% sure.
36_ 13	positive	6- Small but very clear TFT screen.
233_ 40	neutral	In any case , putting aside how common it is in my city , I dont think I can be anymore satisfied.
159_ 0	negative	It took me three days, to the tune of Neil Young's song "Piece Of Cr--!", to get this to work with the satellite hookup I was hired to connect this wireless network up to.
166_ 43	neutral	I'm tr!
130_ 2	positive	This is a quality product, not to be confused with teh cheap junk that Hitachi gets manufactured in China.
36_ 7	neutral	I started shooting even before reading the manual (not recommended at all).
132_ 37	neutral	OVERALL: I highly dislike the iPod, even though the sound quality and design is above-average.
242_ 4	neutral	Not for the impatient.
190_ 27	negative	My friend has an ipod, and although the sound quality probably won't meet most audiophile standards, the product itself is better than anything creative has made.
157_ 2	positive	My opion is concentrate on what you need now, This product has EXELENT range, holds a teady connection, hasent even droped one and i have it for more than a month now.
60_ 2	neutral	The one thing that sets this product apart from the diaper genie is that this product can use regular garbage bags.
136_ 6	neutral	I'm glad I did.
199_ 13	positive	As opposed to the Nomad II or any other flash based player, the songs load extremely fast...about one or two seconds per song.
170_ 19	negative	Cons. 1. Configuration is not easy as it made out to be 2.Lousy Initial Software 3. Does not work with BitSpirit with UPnP, Besides that its an excellent choice , If you know your way around network configuration go for it.
227_ 21	neutral	The subscription service lets me download as much as I want, and the player lets me take it wherever I go.
213_ 15	neutral	it's a little counter intuitive at first, but works great when your used to it.
191_ 13	positive	- Great sound! I was very impressed, I encode at 192 kbps and the audio quality is great, especially with the better headphones.
287_ 42	neutral	They use to be so useful and neceesary.
189_ 0	neutral	This is a difficult player to review because I would recommend it on a case-by-case basis.
68_ 9	positive	If you are looking for a user-friendly diaper pail that actually does keep the odor contained, than the diaper champ is the one for you!
77_ 1	negative	I just wished that it didn't fill up so fast!
278_ 6	positive	N6600 supports midi, wav, amr, mp3 etc.
132_ 473	neutral	The backlight helps out at night, but can be a drain on the battery.
287_ 9	negative	This version of Internet Security 2004, is beyond hope.
199_ 15	neutral	after they have been loaded into the Zen which is something I've had to do many times already.
111_ 14	neutral	2. Half-inch router bits provide more operating security and finish quality than do their 1/4 inch counterparts.
195_ 10	positive	Battery : A Big Big plus.
89_ 5	positive	No one has ever come to my house and noticed 'diaper odor.'
174_ 4	neutral	If a PC asks & takes a DHCP address you'll have that record, but that's it.
142_ 14	neutral	Check it out.
242_ 51	negative	When you consider expandability (downloads via computer), the numerous features, two transmission programs and multiple storage devices, dependability - this is a phone that isn't easy to out-grow.
248_ 7	neutral	Sometimes,the phone gets stuck just like a computer and it doesnt store any incoming call numbers..etc..
212_ 15	positive	If you don't mind all the buttons being touch sensitive, I'd recomment buying it to try out, and also buy an extra 2 year warrenty for it (there are some offered here, for about $15 dollors I think).
227_ 17	negative	Again, this doesn't affect regular MP3 files - just subscription DRM-encoded files, like those from Napster-to-Go or Yahoo Music Unlimited.
233_ 9	positive	Believe me when I say this I have used and fingered all Nokia phones and the 6600 has the best keypad
173_ 9	positive	Overall, it'll make my move that much easier knowing I don't have to worry about connectivity.
0_ 176	neutral	Also make sure you pick up a good high speed SD card like the SanDisk Ultra 2.
132_ 169	positive	 Unless you have an enormous music/audio book library, the 20 GB model should have more than adequate storage capacity, with a stated ability to hold 5000 songs.
203_ 3	positive	You do get 1 more GB than an iPod mini.
237_ 1	neutral	What is that, .00000001 megapixel quality?
314_ 1	neutral	At the same time I bought PC-Cillin for the laptop and what a slick product!
63_ 0	neutral	This pail doesn't really keep in odors anymore and we'll probably have to get a new one, but since you can use regular garbage bags (we actually use the bags we get our groceries in because they hang perfectly) its still probably a better deal than the genie.
132_ 70	positive	 The product I rate five stars,
206_ 13	positive	The computer interface is 90% good, only losing points due to the fact that "Creative" branding is all over the place within it.
287_ 14	neutral	Why they brought this to market is beyond me.
32_ 0	neutral	I'm a writer and new to digital photography.
243_ 0	neutral	*****DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE***** ****READ WHY****
141_ 1	positive	This linksys router does it for the RIGHT PRICE.
201_ 30	positive	Colors: 10 variety of HOT colors made it difficult to choose from.
91_ 8	neutral	However, for the previous 13 months-this is what I encountered - PROS -
106_ 14	neutral	This will allow operation of the power switch with the left index finger and the plunge lock with the left thumb (instead of the standard right thumb and right index finger, respectively), but then the depth scale is on the back face of the router, as is the straight edge of the base plate.
169_ 11	positive	My Xbox connection seems as good as with a cable.
132_ 298	positive	 With the iPod, you can also store documents and contact files (from programs such as Microsoft Outlook) when it's connected to your PC as an external hard drive.
11_ 0	positive	I've been incredibly happy with this camera.
221_ 9	positive	Your choice of ten colors in a beatiful package.
118_ 5	positive	You'll love it!

140_ 12	neutral	I was told to connect my computer directly to the cable modem, then go to a Linksys webs!
154_ 1	positive	My experience with installation was quite good.
166_ 32	neutral	These generally range from not connecting at all, to hosting !
47_ 0	neutral	I've struggled for years with supposedly high-quality point and shoot 35mm cameras delivering astonishingly inconsistent results.
183_ 35	neutral	Some other companies require you to send your player back and then charge you an additional $130 to replace their batteries.
132_ 437	positive	 Has a great helpline.
195_ 37	neutral	Creative has not lounched any silicon cover for the player like ipod's (I think belkin makes it for ipod).
116_ 6	positive	The guide fence for freehand routing is well made and solid.
281_ 9	negative	Being a past Norton customer, I consider this to be a slap to my face.
308_ 0	neutral	I bought Norton Internet Security years ago when it first came out.
262_ 1	positive	Im able to keep my phone on for about a week (mostly stand by) to three days (regular use)
71_ 1	neutral	As a first-time mom, I got the great idea that cloth would be better, and this was the only diaper disposal that advertised compatibility with cloth diapers.
139_ 9	neutral	P2P is just harsh on networking equipment of!
119_ 2	neutral	I have added the router raizer kit(simple installation) to it and cannot live without this setup!
287_ 5	neutral	It has saved my system on more than one occasion, and makes disc clean up a snap.
196_ 14	positive	Also, I am quite partial to the Creative MediaSource Organizer and Player software, which I had with Audigy ZS sound card originally; it is definitely an added plus.
166_ 52	neutral	Moreover, the price of these is very low compared to most computer add-ons, so getting the added functionality is at little, and sometimes no cost.
205_ 13	positive	Also, the touchpad seems to be waterproof to some degree.
217_ 4	neutral	At this point, the Rio Carbon is 5Gb (along with a host of South Korean manufacturers), and eventually the iPod will get a "free" upgrade to 5Gb as the 4Gb trickle down to nothing.
206_ 18	negative	00% good though, and the Zen does have a few drawbacks.
83_ 7	neutral	I am SO thankful I got that advice when I did because I had the Diaper Genie on my registry aforementioned to her warning.
199_ 17	negative	If I was pressed to find a negative aspect of the Zen Micro I would probably have to mention weak FM reception, but the building where I primarily use the Micro seems to have a history of terrible radio reception anyway, so you can take that for what it's worth.
270_ 7	negative	My fingers are kind of stubby so it took a while to learn how to hit a key without hitting the adjacent ones.
213_ 10	positive	+Sorts music by artist, album, genre, etc... it's easy to wade through 5 gigs of tunes to find what you're looking for.
321_ 1	negative	This program would not let me send Outlook Email or listen to Audible sample books online.
139_ 0	neutral	Here is the big news to everyone; this is a consumer level product.
69_ 1	neutral	Everytime I tried to unload it the sausage links(as I call them) would unravel and I think the odor control was only so so.
201_ 7	positive	When I opened the box, I was shocked by the size of this thing... It's TINY!
211_ 7	neutral	All of my files are mp3 or wma, Windows Media Player is my primary music suite, i use it to burn, play, rip, and sync.

70_ 1	positive	It holds a lot of diapers, not to mention the odor!
132_ 274	neutral	 The problem with this is that a) it takes a LOT of time if you have many files and b) audio quality is somewhat lost (if you're an audiophile, this will bother you - frankly, I can't tell the difference).
179_ 1	neutral	Coverage in my 2-floor brick-walled house was poor and erratic.
111_ 6	positive	It is no more heavy than any other powerful router and not as bad as some Porter Cable models I tried.
132_ 243	neutral	 Still my favorite MP3 player  Is it overpriced ?
250_ 8	neutral	This feature is very important to me as I make a lot of international calls.
307_ 12	negative	Sure they say if it's their fault you won't get charged, but THEY are the ones who get to decide whether it's their fault.
221_ 26	neutral	Do NOT buy Apple.
139_ 25	positive	I would highly recommend that you do this if you want to learn something, but if you are not interested in learning this stuff and just want a working wireless router, just get the WRT54G.
39_ 5	positive	This is enough capacity and capability to do a complete household inventory, for example.
132_ 149	neutral	then when i argued with them they told me that they would pick it up.
259_ 1	negative	They have the worst service of any of the major companies.
246_ 1	negative	It's important that people know the following:  First, the interface is slow.
246_ 2	negative	You hit the message button on the front and it takes a matter of SECONDS to bring up the menu.
270_ 12	positive	It's really well made and has survived sliding across floors and pavement without a scratch.
222_ 0	neutral	I must say, after tons of research, I have chosen the right Mp3 player.

224_ 8	negative	I sent Creative customer service 3 emails in which they did not help me one bit and don't seem to even want to help.

137_ 6	positive	Comes with a installation CD which instructs you step by step to setting up the router.
25_ 1	positive	This camera is so light and tiny that I literally carry it everywhere with me, which is great considering I'm an artist and like to capture interesting items for future painting.
132_ 397	neutral	 When this happens I have to toggle the lock switch on and off to get it to work properly.
240_ 12	negative	But not good enough for me.
201_ 14	neutral	I expected this coming from Creative.
131_ 19	positive	For the person that uses the equipment every day, pay the extra and get a reliable & safer unit.
307_ 4	negative	Although I disabled Norton AntiSpam, it is still there.
192_ 4	positive	Pros: - Excellent sound, even with the headphones that come out of the box, but it absolutely rocked with my Bose Quietcomfort 2 set.
100_ 24	positive	Works great!!!!
266_ 5	positive	Overall the phones fantastic, and I would have given it 5 stars, but its not perfect.
132_ 444	positive	The I-Pod is the best thing I have ever used.
132_ 211	neutral	 If you listen to the iPod four hours per day and you get 10 hours per recharge cycle (not the full twelve specified by Apple) then the iPod will give you over 2.5 years of daily listening.
296_ 4	negative	So, DON'T buy this or upgrade.
66_ 2	neutral	My second child I didn't get any.
166_ 61	neutral	The other issue is how secure do you want it.
79_ 0	positive	The diaper champ is the best!
168_ 0	neutral	OK, I never read the manual.
134_ 11	neutral	It turns out to be copyright 2002 and much inferior to the 2005 manual included on the CD.
36_ 4	positive	I've had a lot of cameras, but this one is ACTUALLY being used, and not stored in a desk: it's allways in my shist pocket.
256_ 3	positive	Photos are pretty darned good!
0_ 81	positive	great picture quality - in automatic mode, quality is great.
153_ 4	neutral	If you are sharing a cable modem or DSL, it's probably not going to be noticeable.

142_ 11	neutral	My ISP had me up and running within 5 minutes.
173_ 6	positive	Reset the network, tried the connection, and it's working like a charm.

197_ 5	neutral	The karma also has a very long battery life.
197_ 1	negative	The iPod mini is smaller and sexier, albeit limited in supported formats and the Rio Karma is a far better value.
60_ 0	neutral	A MUST HAVE!
130_ 0	positive	This is a fantastic tool to use.
234_ 10	neutral	Sorry, try something else or at least trying using one.
72_ 1	positive	With the enormous numbers of diapers that you go through with a newborn, it was great how easy it was to dispose of the dirty ones.
205_ 5	positive	I'm not sure whether this is related to the charge cycle of its Li-Ion battery, the better firmware, or a combination of both factors.
162_ 0	neutral	I purchased the router and 1 Linksys WPC54G Wireless 54g PC Card.
170_ 6	neutral	VERY IMP.
82_ 4	neutral	The latch isn't terribly difficult, and I wouldn't want it to be too easy since it sits in my son's room.

149_ 0	neutral	I bought this in order to upgrade from an old 802.11b router to g technology, and I spent several hours trying to get it to work.
254_ 4	positive	A huge beautiful color screen which can not been scratched at all even with the rough handling i give it.
0_ 43	neutral	I have had the SD500 for less than one week.
269_ 0	positive	I really love this phone...
100_ 14	neutral	He thinks it is magic when the diaper "disappears".
264_ 5	neutral	Depending on the timing of the postmark date, you don't get your second bill until the postmark date passes, so it's impossible to qualify for the rebate.
6_ 1	positive	It will not replace your high-end 35mm SLR but it's a great toy to keep near you at all times for snapshots.
0_ 97	positive	if you'll only read the whole manual, you'll find out even more cool features and you'll learn how to manipulate the quality you want to achieve and all those modes will make sense after reading
138_ 18	positive	Overall, if you know what basic steps to take, it was not difficult to connect, and the s/w worked well to connect.
123_ 4	negative	My son tried it and he too couldn't change the speed without an assist.
254_ 3	positive	Get great themes and wallpapers for this phone and many many polyphonic rings.
36_ 15	positive	Don't care about sunlight: it's TFT.
188_ 7	neutral	in principle playlists, album names, artist names, etc would help you organize but this only works IF your tracks have all the necessary data; mine do not.
0_ 29	positive	Sharper pictures.
185_ 6	neutral	The reason why I didn't give the Zen Micro 5 stars is that they also seem to want to conform the the Ipod sense of style.
323_ 7	negative	Is it necessary to scan my MS Money database when I close the program?
135_ 3	neutral	(The Airport was more than twice the Linksys router.)

110_ 5	positive	I would put the Hitachi up with the best!

44_ 1	neutral	Thank you Santa!
132_ 276	neutral	 If this sounds confusing, just make sure you have your iPod plugged in when you install the iTunes software!
183_ 22	negative	I took my Zen Micro with me over the weekend, and was forced to lug my laptop with me on the trip for one reason: to keep the Zen Micro charged.
132_ 411	neutral	 And I'm really not that rough with things!
132_ 477	neutral	 I would strongly recommend you get one !!
183_ 43	positive	) The Zen Micro appears sturdy and well constructed, hefty, if you will, far better than many of its competitors. .
220_ 7	neutral	instead of an iPod (I know this is a tediously recurring theme in these reviews, but I want to get my two cents in) was the FM radio.
259_ 4	neutral	T-Mobile's minute plans are cheaper for a reason.
136_ 22	positive	I hooked the Linksys wireless router up to a broadband connection which is running at a maximum of 700 plus Kilobytes on the download e!
171_ 0	neutral	I have two linksys routers, one wireless g, and the other cabled.
201_ 8	positive	It's shorter, sleeker, more compact and fits comfortably in my small hand than the iPod...My Nokia cell phone towers over this bad boy!
65_ 0	neutral	We received this diaper pail as a gift while expecting our second child.
201_ 11	neutral	:) I was also happy that my shipment came with all the accessories (minus extra battery).
215_ 5	positive	However after playing with it for three weeks now, I'm convinced, the Zen Micro is superior.
227_ 11	neutral	Use Windows Media Player 10 to do your transferring.
242_ 33	negative	The 6600 will provide similar service in more developed areas of The States and not as well in more remote areas.
229_ 8	positive	sending the unit to the company of purchase which costs about $90), the ability to record with a built-in microphone (great for recording reminders and meetings), very sturdy construction, and not to mention...the sound quality is excellent!
68_ 2	neutral	It was such a pain to use.
168_ 4	neutral	When I gave up and called their help desk, they sent me to a web site, I ran a program and viola - I was on the net wirelessly.
154_ 12	positive	I have had no problem either with backward compatiaibility, in that the "mixed mode" feature lets you both 54 and 11 Mb cards off the router.
257_ 0	neutral	What I have found useful to consider before purchasing a phone:  - decent battery life - good call quality - user-friendly interface - camera/video functions - bluetooth - ability to sync contacts stored in the PC with the phone (no more manual entries!)
268_ 20	negative	Especially the bluetooth server... Meaning you have to restart the phone if you want bluetooth to work again.
3_ 6	positive	The picture quality of this camera is outstanding (taking its' size and price into consideration).
125_ 2	positive	The ones I've kept (Porter Cables, Dewalts, Bosch, and this Hitachi) have proven their worth over the years, however, when I need a real workhorse, I grab this router.
307_ 0	neutral	NIS is a package of several Norton products.
188_ 4	positive	The good news is that the creative support is very responsive and after some emails and postal exchanges, i had a new zen.
0_ 57	positive	The pictures are tack sharp, colors are vivid, and at 7 mega pixels the quality is plenty high to manipulate and crop images to your hearts desire.
132_ 525	neutral	 But is it worth all the hype?
183_ 7	negative	Who wants to go through the hassles of loading software onto a "foreign" computer just to move over some simple (*.txt) files?
132_ 481	positive	I love the features on the iPod and the many things you can do with it.
116_ 0	positive	I love the performance and features of this router.
132_ 22	negative	 There is also no voice recording, something most if not all MP3 players have that the iPod doesn't.
217_ 9	neutral	The scroll wheel is not an Apple innovation, but it took Apple to put it on their MP3 player for the obvious to become clear to the industry.
206_ 11	positive	Everything that I have listed above, the Zen has, and more.
259_ 2	negative	I really regret signing up with T-Mobile, but I'm stuck with them for the next 6 months of the contract.
319_ 1	positive	The program is fully featured, with much of what you'd want from a security program --
187_ 11	positive	The touch buttons are textured so that your finger sdon't slip which was very thoughtful.
132_ 198	neutral	However, it fell into one of Apple's worst reputations.
242_ 23	positive	MEMORY/STORAGE - Seemingly boundless.
166_ 25	neutral	Networks on the outside can't see your computer, and unless you install the security protocols incorrectly, all they see is the router, and what can't be seen can't be accessed.
31_ 15	neutral	By the time the shot's taken, something (especially a squirmy child or a sports play) has invariably moved and it's not the exact picture you wanted.
132_ 262	neutral	  THE CONS OF THE IPOD  There are a few advantages to the Nitrus.
278_ 7	positive	it has a handsfree loudspeaker, conference and transfer!
132_ 47	neutral	 the 20 gig because that holds 10,000 songs right there and that's alot of songs.
32_ 5	positive	First, it really is tiny; the size of a pack of cigarettes, maybe  a scooch deeper.
243_ 22	neutral	So, after all this frustration of adding all of my newest contacts to the 6600, I asked the technician if it were possible to transfer the data from the 6600 to the 3650.
57_ 1	neutral	Having one of these helps from needing to take out the trash daily for the guys!
132_ 502	positive	  The click wheel is incredibly convenient, however it can be a little overly touchy at times, which will make you frustrated with your own fingers.
0_ 196	positive	The manual is excellent.
39_ 6	neutral	While this might seem pricy, I have been spending $27 for 25 APS images, with prints and a CD, so this camera will pay for itself in a year.
132_ 355	negative	The biggest red flag for me was the fact that although my cousin's player was relatively new, it was riddled with scratches.
73_ 4	positive	*holds a LOT of diapers--a full week of toddler diapers!
170_ 12	positive	It works well with my VOIP adapter, which is also a Linksys.
201_ 20	positive	There are extra features packed inside this unit (some that most will hardly ever use) such as FM radio tuner, voice recorder, calendar, and alarm clock.
80_ 3	positive	No need for deodorizers.
178_ 14	neutral	I did this and indeed the setup flowed much better.
243_ 1	neutral	In October of 2003, I bought a Nokia 3650 off of eBay.
179_ 3	neutral	Two walls apart from it, the signal would start failing.
0_ 157	neutral	If you want one you better hurry up - supply is low and demand is high which means prices may go way up!
21_ 2	neutral	The  ELPH will do the latter but you must hold down the shutter button to view  it.
132_ 366	neutral	IN SUMMARY: This is a good, basic player.  It's not for everyone, and if you're in the market for one I suggest that you try to put aside the huge popularity of the iPod and look harshly at the actual features that the other players on the market have, and see how they stack up.
91_ 15	neutral	My toddler thought rotating the  top was fun-he always wanted to play with it
65_ 5	neutral	Any diaper pail, if you leave it for long enough, is going to smell.
214_ 10	neutral	So I decided on the black one.
132_ 89	negative	 One caveat I have is that I understand the iPod does not save the photos in such a way that the quality of the image is preserved.
195_ 9	positive	You can use the player to store your computer data files (Good feature to have).
324_ 1	negative	Start up, log off, log on...everything became very slow.
243_ 10	negative	BLUETOOTH DOES NOT WORK ON THIS PHONE.
227_ 18	neutral	These issues knock a single star off the review.
3_ 25	negative	it's not my first choice in cameras,
150_ 3	neutral	If you buy, you should disable the SSID Broadcast, use MAC filtering and deploy some form of encryption (multiple choices)if you want to ensure your network is secure (all covered off in the manual).
254_ 1	positive	You can take pic of your friends and the picture will pop up when they call.
142_ 12	neutral	Also some ISP's give you a discount if you supply your own modem.
287_ 31	positive	Their website had a download that helped remove those, although I had to manually remove a good number of files from the "Programs" directory.
66_ 7	positive	It's also so easy to use and holds a great deal of diapers.
223_ 3	positive	it's a great looking, easy-to-use device but it's the sound quality which is truly amazing -- far better than my Sony mini-disc player.
148_ 0	neutral	I replaced my D-link 802.11b router because it could not hold a connection continuously.
132_ 415	negative	  And if you're a Mac user like me, they've naturally made sure you have no viable alternative.
32_ 13	neutral	But otherwise I am thrilled to have taken the plunge into digital  photography.
209_ 0	neutral	I would give the Creative Zen Micro five stars without hesitation...except for the eight hours of my life I can never get back.
20_ 0	positive	I got this camera for an unbelievably low price at amazon.
212_ 5	negative	After research of other creative hard drive players, i found that most of them aren't very durable and tend to crash (read most reviews on amazon.com and see for yourself).
219_ 2	neutral	Check out message boards on Napster for more info.
94_ 0	positive	Excellent diaper disposal unit.
153_ 5	positive	Linksys quality and tech support have been outstanding.
179_ 7	neutral	Firstly, I mounted the 7dbi antenna pair, replacing the original ones.
96_ 3	positive	While the perfect ordor free diaper pail has yet to be invented, the Diaper Champ is a good as it gets.
30_ 1	positive	I received this little jewel as a gift and I can honestly say Iabsolutely love it.
111_ 12	negative	I have noted that as you use the tool, sawdust builds in the channel and it requires attention.
140_ 0	neutral	I had a Linksys wired 802.11B router and wireless access point which worked well, but decided to upgrade to an all-in-one 11G device.
85_ 5	negative	The pluger gets stuck & you have to manually extract the mess.
108_ 10	negative	The plunge action isn't smooth unless you make it so.
118_ 1	neutral	This router does GREAT in hand held jobs and Router Tables.
0_ 195	neutral	I use "get ready" and "here it comes".
0_ 168	positive	Very good "every day" camera. Fits nicely in the pocket of my jeans and takes quality photos.
190_ 29	neutral	If you're an audiophile, you already know that mp3 players are far from impressive.
145_ 0	neutral	I got this inexpensive  router to let me connect two desktops and a Thinkpad laptop to my NTL broadband modem, instead of having to go through the hassle of rebooting the modem and connecting to a different PC, as and when needed.
136_ 15	positive	Pertaining to the speed issue: I got 54Mps while I was in the same room.
0_ 98	neutral	as a whole, i say, it's way more than what i expected.
213_ 11	neutral	Also provides for playlists which are nice, but really only usefully set up through the PC software.
3_ 13	negative	Another problem I had with this camera was the zoom function.
132_ 400	negative	 Maybe this new design is more durable than the last, but I kind of doubt it.
115_ 7	neutral	If the plunging action isn't that important, then this is a great router.
132_ 344	neutral	    If you can get past this little flaw, give the ipod 5 stars, because everything else about it is pretty much perfect.
0_ 125	neutral	Otherwise, I would have changed my one-liner to "useless" instead of "flimsy".
132_ 58	positive	 The song quality of the iPod is excellent, and the included ear buds are actually more than satisfactory, for most users.
112_ 1	neutral	The owner had three routers - all M12's.
0_ 63	positive	The battery life is not that of the Casio's but its good and your going to get better pictures in my opionion with the battery life youve got.
91_ 2	neutral	Even when empty!
35_ 6	neutral	Turn-on to ready-to-shoot is about 3 seconds.
193_ 34	positive	Creative has put a lot of effort into making this player appeal to those true geeks that search for coolness and functionality in electronic devices.
243_ 11	neutral	THE ADVERTISING IS A LIE.
138_ 11	neutral	So then running the CD, everything worked out OK to connect my wired computers again.
193_ 52	positive	The Earbuds are great headphones as good as my AGK Studio 240, well not as good but darn close.
136_ 20	neutral	Their are 1000 kilobytes in every megabyte.
68_ 6	neutral	It takes regular trash bags.
274_ 17	positive	The bottom line is "Phone is cool one - only for the moment, as its the latest phone in the market and has all the new features, but this will soon be displaced by upcoming newer phones".
89_ 8	neutral	1. CHANGE BAGS FREQUENTLY!!
201_ 27	positive	Transferring music is a breeze. I don't subscribe to music services, but as mentioned on other reviews, Micro allows you to subscribe to services OTHER than iTunes.
208_ 7	neutral	Any audio files in this area can't be played by the player.
73_ 1	neutral	We have been using the Diaper Genie for the past 17 months and are very happy with it.
53_ 3	positive	I don't know if we'll run into trouble down the road with odors, but so far I have no complaints and I'm very happy not to have to buy those refills.
212_ 2	neutral	About the Ipod: it has it's downfalls as well.
299_ 13	neutral	Again, I tried online email support.
183_ 10	positive	The sound is great, the portability, etc... all the "stuff" you expect from a good MP-3 player, this Zen Micro has it.
219_ 1	negative	A lot of people are having problems with the firmware update required to use the player for Napster to Go.. The firmware is beta and they are are a lot of bugs in it.
132_ 113	neutral	 I look at iPod owners today and quietly feel sorry for them. :) They just didn't know about the ARCHOS gmini400.
36_ 16	positive	7- 360 panoramic pictures are a very big deal.
46_ 2	neutral	Really like them,  they work well and the macro function of the 2500 really helps my Ebay biz.
214_ 25	negative	I tried to use the FM radio option, but it doesn't seem to really pick up the stations I listen, however I am going to try it in a different location, it may have just been my residential location.
312_ 9	neutral	Next year when I purchase a 2005 FireWall version, I am buying the Zone Alarm or the sygate one.
5_ 8	negative	2) The delay from the time you fully depress the shutter to the time the picture is taken is too long and may yield some fuzzy shots.
213_ 22	neutral	Simply removing the battery and then replacing it fixes the issue, but it's annoying.
89_ 7	neutral	For those who are experiencing odor problems, here are some suggestions which should solve the problem:
225_ 3	positive	The Zen offered a great alternative.
166_ 14	neutral	It's no wonder many new PCs ship with full hard drive images on DVDs, so you can restore your system back to as-shipped condition.
205_ 16	positive	The player looks great, feels great, and sounds great.
241_ 14	positive	6) The phone is really wide, which seems to be a turnoff for many people, but the phone is actually easier to grip and feel more ergonomic.
272_ 5	positive	Other than that, the simbian series 60 OS is great and offers lots of proprietary software that will work on your phone if you're willing to hunt for it.
122_ 10	neutral	The true test is its ability to be forgiving when coping a rail.
89_ 15	positive	SIMPLE AND IT WORKS!
179_ 12	neutral	Also, I set up a WPA-PSK security protocol, and created a corresponding profile in my notebook.
319_ 3	neutral	My previous experience with multiple Symantec/Norton products has been good.
265_ 1	negative	I was using a Motorola T720i with Verizon and I had alot of dropped calls and I had troubles syncing data.
233_ 6	positive	1.The Phone has the best keypad any Nokia phone has to offer.
146_ 4	neutral	I was fed up and turned to WRT54G because of its positive reviews, good past experience with wired routers and frequent firmware updates to correct any bugs.
132_ 295	neutral	 I had to constantly peel mine off to see which was which, so I finally just got rid of the cushions and don't even notice the difference.
0_ 166	neutral	I had G600(6MP) before this one and I noticed big difference in picture quality and performance using SD500.
193_ 4	neutral	To transfer songs requires you to pay 99 cents.
0_ 35	negative	The only knock I have is that the flash is underpowered.
179_ 5	neutral	Important to note that what I really needed was an access point as my DSL modem already does the router thing and I have a wired 100M network round the house.
186_ 18	neutral	Enjoy!
144_ 11	positive	anted to rate the router higher than 1 star, due to its security, easy of use, etc.
10_ 2	neutral	It's best to list the pros and cons of this camera:
236_ 3	neutral	In those days I've gone from Oki, Motorolla and progressed (actually regressed) to Sony Ericsson's T610.
263_ 2	positive	but this by far is the best phone out there right now!
241_ 13	neutral	This is great for putting photos and memos on the computer and transferring calander data to my phone.
154_ 2	positive	I upgraded both my card and router and really had no problems with installation on my Sony VAIO laptop (XP operating system).
316_ 1	positive	All in all it hasn't been a bad product.
0_ 86	positive	photo stitch (merge pictures to create a panoramic one..even my old one can do this and it's really cool to have it now still)
132_ 294	neutral	But unlike most fashion statements (if this could indeed be seen as one?) this concept is a logical one - the black cushions often cover up the letters on the earbuds that designate whether they're for your left or right ear.
112_ 8	neutral	Unless you routinely use it like this (which I do to cut mortises on the woodrat) then you will never notice.
307_ 6	neutral	I guess the possibility that someone might not want it to run at all never occured to the designers.
225_ 12	neutral	00 song capacity of the disk without having to worry about the quality of your music (the Zen micro, actually starts off with about 4.7GB after loading the software).
175_ 6	negative	Now this router is not the cheapest on the market.
82_ 1	positive	At first I had a problem with some smell, then I realized if you flip the lid back and always keep the same side facing in - then there is no smell at all!
53_ 2	neutral	I also sprinkled baking soda in the bottom of the Diaper Champ to help absorb odors - every once in awhile I just empty the old baking soda out and replace it.
132_ 319	neutral	 Let me say first, that I have always been a hater of all things Apple.
224_ 12	neutral	I don't want to keep testing my luck.
290_ 6	neutral	It usually only takes 5-10 MB's of system memory.
88_ 5	neutral	Now that our son's diapers are a little larger, they take up more space, and we empty twice a week.
240_ 5	negative	And, other else,  the camera is still VGA.
200_ 4	negative	If someone asked me flat out, i'd say to go woth something else.
139_ 14	neutral	The really neat thing about this is that the third party firmware are very powerful and add many more features to the WRT54G that are not there, but should be.
79_ 24	neutral	The positives outway the negatives.
79_ 10	neutral	The Champ also has hinges for you to place a new bag.
0_ 224	negative	There were many times when I clicked the automatic shutter and nothing happens.
206_ 17	neutral	Not everything in this world is 1!
197_ 7	neutral	No comparison in my opinion.
132_ 273	neutral	So, I downloaded another program (Switch freeware) and manually changed the WMA files to MP3, then downloaded them to the iPod.
132_ 343	negative	  This was obviously a conspiracy as it is FREAKIN' EASY to manufacture a device with replaceable batteries!!
146_ 5	positive	I'm happy to say that this router was exactly what I was looking for.
279_ 3	positive	Many of these programs are shareware, some can be purchased by paying a little bit of bucks.
217_ 11	neutral	It's easy to find songs, organize songs, and also carry some essentials and diversions.
54_ 12	neutral	Just flip the handle and the diaper is gone!
179_ 6	negative	Setting up the system was not too complicated.
255_ 2	positive	It is slow to initially start up, but once it's turned on, I've never had any complaints about the speed.
174_ 6	neutral	I'm disappoointed Linksys still doesn't allow mapping specific IP addressses in DHCP (what Windows Server people call Reservations).
83_ 3	neutral	It takes garage bags that we use elsewhere in the abode.
251_ 12	neutral	5- If you already have a girlfriend and/or wife , you won't need Bluetooth lol .
233_ 23	positive	5.The Camera installed on this phone is awesome.
225_ 26	neutral	At least, that is, while it's still alive.
225_ 28	neutral	It's a tad too sensitive for a first time user (my family member, however, had no problem with it), and it drove me nuts at first.
311_ 3	negative	Their site offers no live help at all.
42_ 1	positive	After getting one for Christmas from Amazon, I'm now a believer:  The Digital Elph is truly the world's smallest digital camera that shoots great pictures.
114_ 10	negative	I also removed the springs in the plunge  tubes to make it easier to raise.
167_ 0	neutral	I'm using sveasoft's firmware, but search the web for more information about it--you may find you don't approve of the author's tactics, which I only learned about after I'd paid my $20 subscription.
166_ 8	neutral	Why own one of these things then, especially if you only have one computer.
298_ 13	neutral	We'd used Norton products like Internet Security 2003 forever with only rare troubles.
307_ 8	positive	This did manage to cut the number of popups during start-up from 4 down to 2.
43_ 2	neutral	We bought extra memory and a backup battery (so we can use one while the other is charging).
170_ 16	neutral	But this seems to be isolated only to the latest version of this particular program.
141_ 0	neutral	I was waiting for wireless to be faster then 11mbs.
225_ 61	neutral	In other words, you have to do almost the equivalent of open heart surgery in order just to see where the problem is.
131_ 13	negative	You must keep double checking depths.
0_ 134	positive	The size of the camera is perfect.
19_ 1	positive	I would recommend this camera unequivocally!
61_ 0	negative	I find the major problem with this item is that if you have a very messy diaper and can't tightly bundle it without a mess, the mess gets all over the module that dumps the diaper and the stink is OUTSIDE of the diaper pail.
35_ 7	negative	I'd give it  5 stars if the automatic modes were better and if there were true manual focus and exposure modes.
209_ 5	neutral	Are you feeling lucky today?
225_ 36	positive	One: It's size: It's smaller than the Ipod Mini, and holds more music (5GB to the IPOD mini's 4GBs).
233_ 35	negative	The battery life of this phone is at most 2 days and at least one day at excessive use.
287_ 36	negative	As of October, 2004, these products are NOT working and I'm ready to demand a refund from Symantec.
250_ 12	negative	In noisy environment, it's hard to hear from the earpiece.
189_ 10	neutral	Bottomline, don't even bother with the software that comes with the Zen Micro.
257_ 4	neutral	Motorola's phones are well engineered but have an user interface that reflects very poorly on what is otherwise an excellent engineering company.
110_ 1	positive	I don't have problems with the depth adjustment, the speed control, the collet ( I haven't tried the 1/4" sleeve yet) .
132_ 13	neutral	 However, the Creative and iRiver players are (Rio's isn't), and they only cost around $30 to replace, while iPod charges shipping and technical support.
202_ 0	neutral	It's nice that the Zen Micro has bells and whistles like FM (but where's AM???) and voice recording, and 20% more storage than "the other" mini MP3 player, but why is it so (...)ugly?
132_ 238	neutral	 That's the only advice I would give to someone considering an iPod purchase: you really may not really need 20GB or 40GB.
8_ 2	positive	I love this camera.
183_ 28	neutral	Their product may appear more enconomical, but it isn't in the long run. .
254_ 6	positive	Best phone i've ever owned, period.
124_ 6	negative	The only not-so-positive comment I have is about the depth adjustment, it is not easy to micro-adjust accurately.
132_ 480	neutral	I ended up (surprisingly) getting one for Christmas.
166_ 70	neutral	Let me give you a word about AOL, and other service providers.
224_ 9	neutral	I've heard many good reviews of this product and I wonder if maybe I just had bad luck.
304_ 7	neutral	Avoid like the plague.
144_ 4	neutral	Although it will work for a few minutes, it will eventually hang.
18_ 1	negative	 the only thing I don't like about it is that You have to buy a larger memory card, first thing!
311_ 15	neutral	Detractors should spend more time actually customizing the program to meet their needs instead of being lazy & complaining just for the hell of it.
97_ 6	negative	Don't buy the diaper champ.
99_ 3	neutral	I just knew all along what products I would not use, but was undecided on the actual one I wanted.
132_ 102	negative	 Cons: No AM/FM Radio Tuner-- Something a large number of competetors are doing
132_ 136	positive	 As for iTunes, I don't find it to be as good as the Windows Media Player as a computer mp3 player, but it is good enough.
269_ 1	neutral	I also am loving T-Mobile (100 times better than ATT...
217_ 27	neutral	Please judge any review you read -- in any medium, be it here or newspapers or magazines -- by its own merits. ****  Fred
132_ 496	neutral	It's still an absolutely unbeatable value for the amazing technology you're getting, so don't let a few petty cons dissaude you from owning THE coolest thing on the planet right now for any music lover.
80_ 7	positive	This holds alot and does not take up alot of space.
208_ 3	negative	It is not a perfect product but it does have a lot going for it.
131_ 18	positive	For the hobbiest, it's probably a nice buy.
290_ 0	neutral	I originally had bought Norton Internet Security for my laptop after the preinstalled Norton Antivirus trial had finished.
15_ 0	neutral	I have used this camera for about 3 weeks so far, taking over 500 pictures.
223_ 8	neutral	I just close the program down first, wait for the message to appear on the Micro, then unplug it.
210_ 5	negative	Of course one of the first things I did was write an email to the customer support at Creative, through their website, and by the time they finally got back to me - several working days later when they promise only one - their suggestions were completely worthless.
183_ 32	negative	If you want to purchase a real case or container or clip-on carrier for you Zen Micro, expect to purchase it separately and to dish out big time. .
189_ 41	neutral	* Of Course, if you've BOUGHT tracks from iTunes, this won't work.
185_ 7	negative	and supply those stupid white Headphones.
132_ 199	neutral	 It is very closed to services and programs outside of Apple's small (though luxiourious, admittedly) island.
79_ 16	neutral	Don't Caregivers need more simplicity in their lives?
194_ 7	positive	I love the touchpade controls.
210_ 2	negative	After installation, the very first time I booted up the Creative MediaSource Organizer, intending to use its CD burning and ripping functions, it totally shorted out.
62_ 2	neutral	I have no issues w/ odor but baby poop doesn't start to smell really bad till they start on soilid so odor will not be a problem no matter what till then and that's many many months down the road.
179_ 15	positive	The box is upstairs, and in the farthest room I get connected at 11-18M speed - that is similar to the older 10M ethernet standard.
35_ 10	neutral	You need to use the manual exposure adjustment in backlight or bright light conditions such as with snow in the background.
189_ 5	neutral	I'll talk more about that later.
32_ 21	positive	At any rate, if you have been interested in  digital photography but the price and confusion have held you back,  consider the Canon S100 Digital Elph.
183_ 19	negative	You have to purchase that separately for some outrageous cost.
212_ 19	neutral	Why go in circles to find something you want? (  :)  )
251_ 11	negative	4- My idea was that it was an all-in-one , and that theory -once again- proves wrong , this phone excells at nothing , less  than average in everything , if you seriously need any of the "other than phone" functionalities , you'll be disappointed .... if you have lots of money and bought it for the love of gadgets then fine .... but don't expect to get much done .
151_ 6	positive	Unlike other reviewers, I have found the support to be responsive, almost no wait time on the phone, and relatively knowledgeable.
252_ 3	positive	High quality video and pictures rock!
170_ 14	negative	The internet connection would go down every 5 mins when I used it with a P2P program called Bitspirit.
179_ 18	positive	Apart from speed, the signal is consistent and works without interruptions, etc.
132_ 487	neutral	Amazing.
28_ 0	neutral	Recently I was at dinner with some friends, and we were debating the merits of one digital camera vs. another.
90_ 0	positive	I love the diaper champ, it is really easy to use and since you can use regular garbage bags it doesn't cost an arm and a leg for refills.
180_ 0	negative	We bought this about 6 months ago and it's been worthless.
324_ 4	neutral	Avoid at all costs
93_ 3	neutral	I mean, with babies it's already far too easy to run out of diapers or formula.
212_ 3	negative	As for the Zen Micro:\  Cons:  I read that every button is touch sensitive, and thats very annoying when all the main buttons are on the front.
136_ 26	positive	Broadband hooked up to this wireless setup flies.
227_ 20	positive	I got it to use with the new $5-per-month service from Yahoo (Music Unlimited,) and despite the above issues, I love it.
267_ 7	positive	7. Have a good chunk of my small MP3 to listen through the speaker phone.
201_ 3	neutral	I've played around with a friend's iPod a couple times and it IS a cool unit.
217_ 0	neutral	... then this might intrigue you greatly.
166_ 38	neutral	Your newness to the world of computing, and Internet surfing makes you a prime target of E-mail spoofers, identity thieves, and others who would attempt to take your private information.
243_ 13	neutral	While the two devices will pair, the phone will immediately drop the connection if any data is transferred.
174_ 19	neutral	WPA is best.
233_ 4	positive	It has raised the bar owing to number of features it offers and the absolute ease of use delight.
189_ 13	neutral	Set the sensitivity of the touch pad to LOW.
132_ 328	neutral	 To adjust the volume, you just sweep your finger lightly along the click  wheel.
311_ 16	neutral	Once you set it up, you barely even notice it's even there.
213_ 28	negative	) -Can't be left in the car... it immediately shuts down with an overheating error if left in a hot car for too long.
156_ 2	positive	All of the wireless components that I bought were a breeze to set up as well.
225_ 22	positive	Track #, name, artist, album and genre is automatically-retrieved via internet-labeled, and properly catergorized into the Zen.
242_ 34	positive	As the 6600 uses 900mhz, it operates in more countries than the 6620.
0_ 150	positive	it's fast, feels great in your hand and looks great too.
123_ 3	negative	It was impossible to change the speed with just my fingers.
287_ 13	negative	I've had to install and uninstall them four or five times so far, and I've not to get either product working properly.
275_ 0	neutral	my number one criteria for a new phone was iSync compaibility via bluetooth.
305_ 0	neutral	Well, I must be one of the few fortunate ones on here.
314_ 2	neutral	So now, when we type, half the time the XP Pro 2.4 Gig PC lags behind the input, sometime by 10 characters!
0_ 113	positive	I still have my s70 because I like the wider lens sometimes, but in general, if you are looking for a small camera with the whole package, the sd500 is the only one you should buy.
213_ 19	negative	whatever...  on to the negatives:  -touchy about charging... you can damage the battery and seriously decrease it's life if you don't upgrade the firmware OR dont' heed the advice to always plug in the player side of the cord before plugging in the outlet side.
200_ 3	negative	It is the 'first generation' of the player, and while I still agree that it is a great alternative to the iPod, I think there are many others that would be a much better value for your buck.
132_ 173	positive	 Features: click wheel to navigate; ability to work with Windows or Mac; optional backlighting (you can have it on all the time, or have it shut off to save battery power after 5, 10, or 20 seconds); ability to download PDA info; automatic or manual download from iTunes when iPod is plugged into your computer.
56_ 1	positive	it's easier and much more convenient to use because it doesn't have CLUMSY and CONFUSING (not to mention expensive) refills.
190_ 24	negative	I got about 700 loaded up before it told me I was full, and at that point, I was ready to toss it out the window.
3_ 7	neutral	However, I do have a few things to complain about...
0_ 5	neutral	I sincerely question the CNET reviewer's ability and/or their bias.
204_ 8	neutral	I take mine everywhere.
287_ 41	neutral	And that's a shame.
265_ 13	negative	On occasion I'm not able to connect to the phone with iSync via Bluetooth but I found that rebooting the phone seems to solve this problem.
111_ 9	neutral	LIKE other reviewers I can attest to the following:
188_ 11	positive	i didnt have any installation problems; and the touch pad is fine, even if it is sort of inaccurate.
0_ 141	positive	I like to take pictures when I Go out at night and perhaps some people would complain that noise levels are high at higher iso's but I don't really care that much, i think it gives the pictures a certain real-life quality.
0_ 119	neutral	I am still waiting news as to whether I will be charged for the 2nd time.
313_ 4	neutral	I've tried lots of things they suggest.
193_ 29	neutral	 You will find a small folder/envelope on top along with the player.
132_ 386	neutral	I would go along the lines of any more than 2 thousands songs, get a larger size such as the 40GB, just to be on the safe side.
132_ 244	neutral	 Dunno, possibly but you have to ask yourself what you are neccessarily paying for, which is 20GBs worth of storage capacity, which even if all your music is in high fidelity such as 320kpbs, there is still a whole lot of room to place much music in here.
46_ 0	neutral	I've got a couple of digital cameras.
221_ 19	neutral	They've partnered with Napster to give you a! free month of the subscription service (read: all the music you want free for thirty days, when you can cancel with all your music safely hidden away.
229_ 5	neutral	An Apple Ipod Mini was considered.
298_ 6	negative	Norton online support does not even acknowledge this problem nor does the computer company that preloaded it on our new computer.
132_ 183	neutral	Since nothing is perfect, the iPod does have some disadvantages, such as its reliance on iTunes to download music (if you hate iTunes, don't buy an iPod!).
174_ 22	neutral	Encryption means people can't join OR read what you're doing.
111_ 1	neutral	I use routers solely for hand work and relegate all table usage (including panels) to my Grizzly shaper.
147_ 9	neutral	I did know about this from researching on the internet before purchasing it, but I bought it anyway.
177_ 0	positive	Getting the router setup in a "vanilla" configuration that works for 99% of users was very easy, and I was able to do this no problem.
241_ 20	positive	Other than that it meets or surpasses all of my needs and surely won't disappoint any already established Nokia phone fans.
98_ 1	positive	I was using the cheapie pail...and it worked ok until the opening device fell apart.
89_ 2	negative	 Too costly and not efficient if you ask me!
162_ 6	neutral	Before I had to manually put my IP settings into my laptop every time I switched networks.
193_ 36	positive	It makes the Nomad I purchase feel and look like junk.
132_ 193	neutral	great product with Limited Services
233_ 2	negative	I thought it was kind of steeply priced at that time.
199_ 1	neutral	I really like both of them and as with any other popular products, they both have their share of negative reviews warning of their shortcomings.
196_ 1	positive	Thankfully, Creative has come through with a product that puts the Ipod back in its place.
225_ 23	neutral	This feature wo!
287_ 15	negative	First, it serious, serious installation problems.
132_ 94	positive	Decently Sized Screen-- One of the larger ones on the market at 2"
7_ 5	positive	Have a great and easy to use bundled software
163_ 0	neutral	This concept seems to be unusual.
211_ 26	positive	Creative has been making computer sound equipment for decades and with the zen micro it finally has something with enough quality and, yes, charm to win a nice size of the digital player pie.
143_ 4	positive	And the tech writers have made the installation process SO EASY for people lik my aunt to follow.
207_ 10	negative	They obviously have quality and reliability problems.
187_ 15	positive	Sound  I'm no audiophile but I was amazed by the clarity the player had, it was much better than the sound card on my Computer and louder too.
89_ 13	neutral	Hello, it does house dirty diapers!!
300_ 1	negative	This is definitely one of those products, especially as the company is leaning more towards making a profit.
275_ 14	negative	if there was a zero-star rating i would give it.
32_ 6	neutral	The included battery charger is larger!
166_ 49	neutral	True, you don't need more than an access point, and a wired one at that, to use as a protective firewall.
215_ 10	positive	Mine is as easy to use as the mini without any firmware download.
283_ 0	negative	Yeah - this program protects your computer all right - by locking you off the internet.
138_ 15	neutral	But knowing that the IP for my previous Linksys router was 192.162.1.1, I went there and found a drop down screen that had the information (the security key) I needed to connect my wireless laptop.
225_ 13	neutral	When mine died, I had 1,022 songs loaded, but only used a little over 2gb of space.
239_ 4	neutral	Camera is nice, and video recording for some reason is only limited to 9 seconds.
274_ 4	positive	2) Nice features, like web browser, camera, video recorder, speaker phone (very usefully), clear voice reception.
108_ 4	positive	The included fence guide is easy to set up and quite accurate as well.
151_ 9	positive	at works as well as can be expected for products in this space and the company backs it up with good support.
131_ 14	positive	But, for the money it is a good machine.
321_ 3	negative	Buy this if you like mental challenges or trying how to pick locks.
214_ 3	neutral	In addition, I didn't like the fact that I'd have to pay $.99 for each song I wanted to download.
225_ 67	neutral	out the bulletin boards.
212_ 12	positive	It also has tons more features then previous creative products, and most of them are very useful such as the ability to custimize the main menu to show the stuff you want, not the default items (creativelabs.com for more on that).
213_ 23	neutral	The new firmware fixes this as long as you put the player in lock mode before plugging it into said PC.
202_ 4	neutral	Creative should hire some real industrial designers.
132_ 33	neutral	If your battery dies and it's still under warranty, guess what, you're out of luck, because Apple doesn't cover the battery in the iPod warranty.
132_ 396	neutral	 I like the click wheel OK, but actually the one problem I've had with this, my third, iPod is that occassionally the wheel gets "stuck," meaning either it won't respond at all, or it "jumps" down playlists uncontrollably.
143_ 5	positive	A very well made product that has worked very well for me over the years.
229_ 9	positive	As far as user interface is concerned, the best and easiest to use seems to be the one that comes with the player, 'Creative MediaSource Organizer'.
213_ 27	neutral	er compatibility, you can't downgrade the firmware.
176_ 8	neutral	If you currently own a wireless router (802.11b) don't rush to replace it!
103_ 7	negative	Otherwise, get a smaller single speed router, which will be much easier to use freehand and is all you need for smaller diameter bits.
132_ 128	neutral	  Again, another hassle.
166_ 60	neutral	As said before, you may get some conflicts.
110_ 6	positive	No vibration!
166_ 0	neutral	First, I must point out that any router installation is not for the faint of heart.
99_ 7	positive	We just buy the smaller bags that come like 250 to a roll and are sented and they are like $6.00 and they work great.
103_ 1	positive	But I wanted to do some raised panel work and needed more power and variable speed to run the large-diameter bits.
163_ 3	neutral	They also lowered flash memory from 4 to 2 MB at the same time.
59_ 0	neutral	WRONG!
132_ 476	neutral	 Talk about convenience.
204_ 7	negative	The touch buttons do take a little getting used to and I don't like how the scroll button is the same button used as an "enter" key, but you get used to it and it isn't a big deal.
65_ 8	positive	I highly recommend this!
206_ 10	neutral	My list of "nice to have" features is a little longer, but it also contains nothing unreasonable: backlit screen, removable battery, FM Radio feature, ID3 Tag line support, lots of storage.
299_ 12	negative	I've searched the program and their online tech support (worthless) and have found no solutions.
132_ 347	neutral	Good, But Not For Everyone
0_ 167	neutral	If you don't care about manual controls then its for you!
256_ 14	negative	Once it froze so bad I couldn't even use the power button to turn it off, and had to open and take out the battery.
185_ 4	neutral	I am the type of person that will always go against the masses of blind followers so there was no way I was getting an Ipod.
270_ 9	negative	Also the battery life isn't great but it's sufficient for my needs.
291_ 5	neutral	Apparently, they can't even fix the bugs that have overrun their own site.
107_ 3	neutral	It is a heavy but well-balanced machine, which is an asset when maximum stability is desired.
31_ 16	neutral	I'm going to buy a real Single-Lens Reflex (SLR) to take baby pictures, but I'll keep this as a travel camera.
109_ 4	positive	Other than that, i think it is the best router for the money.
91_ 9	positive	Using your own bags is much cheaper and convenient.
229_ 7	positive	Some features that the 'Zen Micro' has that sold me on my purchase include: a 5G hard drive...actually an SD flash card drive...very large and much more than actually needed, the ability to sync with Microsoft Outlook's calendar, the long battery life of about 10 to 12 hours (I can change the battery myself for about $40 to buy vs.
139_ 22	neutral	All wireless routers need to be configured to use Wireless Encryption, so this is just not a problem with the WRT54G.
76_ 6	neutral	Once your child goes on to solid foods BEWARE!
268_ 30	positive	But if you use all bluetooth accessories, as I do, its really not an issue.
132_ 225	positive	The sound is INCREDIBLE; very clean, very wide dynamic range of bass, mids and highs, and can be very loud if I turn it up full blast.
98_ 4	positive	I could probably use a trash can and be ok at this point, but this prduct seems to work very well so far.
132_ 17	neutral	 While all MP3 players are easy to scratch, the iPod is the worst of the Creative and iRiver.
254_ 5	positive	Nokia makes great phones, and this one is the cream of the crop.
83_ 0	neutral	She said her sister had the Diaper Champ and that it took regular garbage bags and worked just as well.
185_ 2	neutral	This proprietory software to download.
143_ 2	neutral	Make sure you read the documentation CLEARLY if you dont know what you're doing.
214_ 6	positive	I finally decided to purchase this player because it was compatible with Napster 2 Go....which is a subscription service, allowing me to download as much music as I want for a $14.95 flat fee.
112_ 7	negative	The only beef that I have with it is that there is a little too much slop in the columns when the lock is not engaged.
232_ 2	positive	6600 looks and feels nice.
217_ 18	neutral	What device would I recommend?
3_ 26	positive	I have come across many other beginner cameras that I prefer over this camera, but the thing you have to keep in mind about this camera is the size.
79_ 14	neutral	Special bags are expensive, hard to find, and you never have enough.
287_ 32	negative	If you have an older version of "Internet Security" installed, you may also need to remove it as well before proceeding with SystemWorks install.
248_ 2	negative	This phone is not suitable for fast people, maybe only for old people.
241_ 2	positive	What makes it so great is the versatility and the number of features it has.
0_ 14	negative	When I went to put in the new SD Card I looked at the LCD Screen -- CRACKED-- and the fluid gave a Jackson Pollock type appearance to the screen, black and blue and purple blotches and streaks --useless.
111_ 13	negative	Not a killer problem, but not well done, either.
298_ 7	neutral	It's a well-known company that I expected more from and spent 2 hours with tech support running all kinds of tests on the computer which of course came back reporting no trouble with the computer.
0_ 207	positive	I am impressed with this camera inside and out.
132_ 462	neutral	Burning CDs from iTunes is much easier than the Windows Media Player, which I was previously using.
188_ 0	positive	I think that for its price compared to the ipod the creative zen is pretty good.
223_ 5	neutral	I can't comment on the bundled software as I haven't even looked at it.
170_ 5	negative	The firmware has bugs too, so download and install the latest firmware from Linksys.
0_ 55	neutral	Expected better from a $500 unit.
211_ 22	neutral	Also all the required cables and what not.
197_ 0	neutral	This device looks pretty nice but it's really not very competitive.
0_ 213	positive	The camera responce is VERY quick.
132_ 209	positive	 Battery non-issue.
214_ 2	neutral	However, as soon as I found out that I could only download songs from iTunes, I immediately decided that was NOT the MP3 player for me.
211_ 5	positive	It's still alive, still kicking, and still playing.
35_ 17	positive	It's so small and light, even with a spare battery, you really can take it anywhere.
243_ 32	neutral	Two weeks later I mailed the phone in for repair.
287_ 8	neutral	Well, no more.
191_ 17	positive	- Replaceable battery.
0_ 1	positive	It has an exterior design that combines form and function more elegantly than any point-and-shoot we've ever tested.
186_ 5	neutral	All I can say is what a wonderful choice!
132_ 448	neutral	Also, a word of warning, hide the White Earbud headphones, because they are the most noticable earphones ever and your precious I-Pod could be stolen from you if you don't take steps to hide it from view of other people.
208_ 4	positive	The FM tuner, the 5G of storage, and the removable disk are all great features.
201_ 9	positive	The interface has a sassier flair and the blue-lit trimming is an added bonus.
132_ 471	neutral	 It is sharper on the 'mini' units.
243_ 2	neutral	It was an OK phone with a really nice screen, great battery life, decent signal, and cool applications.
316_ 0	neutral	I've had the last 3 versions of NIS.
298_ 9	neutral	It wasn't the computer - it was Norton Internet Security 2004 which is the culprit!!
320_ 6	neutral	Next I de-fragged my hard drive.
263_ 1	neutral	i have owned many phones with them such as v60, 6190, e715, 6610, v66, v205.... and the list can go on!
324_ 11	negative	Of course, if you try to reach Symantec customer service you get useless automated systems unless you want to pay $30 per incident.
213_ 3	neutral	she also got me an iRiver FM modulator that plugs into the ligher outlet, so i can play it through my regular radio.
0_ 71	positive	My SD500 focuses flawlessly, does not "whine" during video, and my pictures are razor sharp.
100_ 12	neutral	With them, you have to put your baby on the floor or someplace else safe just to put the diaper in the pail.
287_ 35	neutral	Even this, however, did not solve my problems.
268_ 8	neutral	The KDE Bluez system for bluetooth support.
25_ 8	positive	Other than that, I love this camera.
201_ 5	positive	Whichever it may be, I'm happy I've made this purchase.
76_ 5	neutral	I still like it but don't think it rates the 5 stars I gave it but can't change that.
225_ 8	positive	It's easy to use, and makes transfering your CD collection to the player a cinch.
106_ 12	neutral	The M12V is really set up for right hand operation.
278_ 9	neutral	I'll have to buy bigger MMC card of course.
164_ 0	neutral	This is a good product, but the Linksys 54g desktop card is not.
306_ 11	negative	Again, every review written about the Tech Line is true...after waiting close to 45 minutes I finally spoke to a rep.
233_ 19	positive	The phone is sturdy.
278_ 4	negative	you can't do that with a Sony T610 (which i traded for a 6600).
196_ 16	negative	P.S.  The only snag I encountered while initially configuring the device was trying to hook up the Micro to a front USB port.  The bus for the front port on my motherboard did not have enough power; after connecting it to the rear ports, it works perfectly.
132_ 97	positive	 FireWire & USB2.0-- For those fortunate enough to have FireWire400, your in for a real treat with autosync.
194_ 2	positive	It's so small.
195_ 31	positive	Fits well in hand in trouser pockets.
205_ 15	positive	Its ability to record radio is useful as well, but would have been moreso if it could be preset.
97_ 2	neutral	Large diapers have to be wrapped tightly.
168_ 8	positive	If you want to work wirelessly, this router does just what you want it to do and my geek friends say that the security is as good as it gets right now.
135_ 4	negative	HOWEVER, configuration of my system and actual setup of the router for wireless use took me more than 3 hours, and briefly made me reconsider my choice to forego the airport and its notoriously easy setup.
185_ 3	neutral	(That was a major turn off).
225_ 29	neutral	A trick I used was to manually capitalize all the info.
132_ 175	positive	  With accessories, you can make the iPod into a digital recorder, broadcast it remotely through stereo speakers using wireless technology, and play it through your car speakers using either a CD adaptor or FM stereo broadcaster.
132_ 288	positive	 The!  sound quality is great.
117_ 3	positive	One cabinet shop has been using one regularly in a router table for 11 years without a problem.
111_ 3	positive	Saw the Hitachi on Amazon.com with their $25.00 coupon (at the time) and could not resist trying it out.
202_ 3	neutral	What's the point of having "good audio" in your hand when your g/f thinks you have no taste whatsoever and your friends laugh their heads off while proudly showing off their iPod Mini?
189_ 14	neutral	Also, as soon as you select a song and set your desired volume level, put the player on HOLD.
209_ 14	neutral	You're better off not dropping below 128 kbps, especially with music.
0_ 129	negative	Although the SD500 takes great quality photos, the sensitivity of the LCD compromises the quality overall.
116_ 3	neutral	I bought this specifically for a router table I built, and it has performed flawlessly in that capacity.
0_ 182	positive	I also tend to like the sliding cover/on switch found on many compact PS cameras since it's much faster and easier to power on if you need to take that instant shot.
114_ 3	positive	Also I like the  position of all the controls and the fact that it doesn't have any extra  knobs or gizmos.
211_ 27	positive	Pick your favorite color and buy it.
135_ 1	positive	I recently bought the Linksys WRT54G router and have been very happy with the router itself.
0_ 66	negative	The disadvantages of this camera is it has been having some trouble with its autofocus on a few occasional pictures, especially quick candid shots where you start up and shot as quick as you can.
111_ 11	negative	Mine was so bad I had to to use a hammer to free it (and this is why I'm giving it 4, not 5 stars).
132_ 296	positive	  The ease of use of the iPod is a major attribute.
132_ 350	neutral	  Overall, I think the iPod is a good player, although I would note some features that turned me off:
186_ 10	neutral	I did a quick test by selecting a few files and copying them over and they loaded right in.
132_ 139	positive	 In conclusion, I gave the iPod a 4/5 because anything this expensive should would work just about flawlessly.
299_ 0	neutral	I have always sworn by Norton Anti-Virus and SystemWorks products, and have used them both for years.
132_ 409	neutral	  These are nice ones, and you get great sound at first, but again, they break if you even think mean things about them.
275_ 4	negative	namely, it wouldnt sync.
110_ 12	positive	The soft start is nice.
132_ 529	neutral	 However, having said that, this could just be because I haven't really had enough time to experience it in its entirety.
178_ 8	neutral	When you open the package the first thing you see is "Run CD first".
165_ 2	positive	My brother had an old Linksys B band wireless router in his home and it was like magic.
132_ 134	neutral	Someone wrote that they haven't been able to upload songs from burned cds; I have not found this to be so.
263_ 6	neutral	I use this phone as my quick and dirty digital camera!
0_ 7	neutral	I post under JTL at dcresource...check out my images if you want to see what this camera can do.
175_ 2	positive	No down time, great signal strength.
41_ 1	neutral	Somehow, the engineers at Canon did it, and the results are nothing less than astounding.
242_ 24	positive	First of all, the phone houses a great deal of memory for multiple videos, sound clips, photos, texts, etc.
157_ 1	neutral	In my opinion a year is a good service time for a device, I dont expect this router or any other to work great for more than a year.
319_ 9	neutral	I am going to uninstall this and stick with my old version until they offer a fix or until I can find a program from another vendor.
286_ 2	neutral	Even for computer super-heros it's a pain to maintain when there is a problem.
142_ 13	neutral	  !
0_ 186	positive	In low light with flash I found it clear better then the sony P200 (too much red, colours overall not as natural but fewer red-eyes).
292_ 0	negative	I have found too many bugs in Norton Internet Security Professional to recommend it to any one without extreme patience and experience.
218_ 1	neutral	I wanted something more portable, shirt-pocket sized, and something to complement the new Yahoo Music Unlimited site.
45_ 2	neutral	I also recently bought Viking's IntelliFlash Memory Reader.
225_ 25	neutral	Just check the menu on your Zen, and it's all there, and neatly stored.
263_ 11	neutral	If you own an apple you can isync it to your address book so that you have all of you numbers in two places..... in case you lose your phone (get INSURACE)
207_ 21	neutral	It's supposed to support that format, but I keep getting a file transfer failure no matter what I try.
273_ 1	negative	These people takes lest effort to process rebate forms.
130_ 1	negative	Only problem is that is a bit heavy.
224_ 10	positive	It was a good player when it worked and I loved the design.
80_ 6	positive	I use the scented bags and even if I don't no smell!
91_ 5	neutral	So then I used straight bleach.
187_ 12	positive	Reliability & Build  I dropped the player once from about 4 ft, and it fell hard, but kept on playing.
207_ 4	neutral	Then last week, my player just quit working, period.
194_ 5	positive	The sound is amazing.
132_ 231	positive	 The sound quality is excellent, accessing the music is easy, and the controls are generally well thought out.
295_ 2	neutral	Maybe it's me, but this isn't my program.
91_ 14	negative	Diapers can get stuck when turned around if you don't tightly wrap them first.
247_ 1	positive	very cool features... great camera with zoom...cool quality pictures... great ringtones... bluetooth feature is great....
93_ 2	neutral	Not only can they be a pain to install, but who needs one extra thing to watch a supply of?
148_ 3	neutral	This is because the Lucent drivers use PIO whereas the Broadcom drivers use DMA.
294_ 2	neutral	The former hogs memory and it takes ages for the computer to start.
233_ 36	negative	Video recording is limited at just 9 seconds.
189_ 24	positive	 FM radio built in (Howard Stern).
100_ 15	positive	3.  Bags are easy to change.
106_ 3	neutral	Hitachi includes a 1/2" straight cutting bit in the package, and I used this to cut out my table.
126_ 2	positive	I couldn't believe what I had been missing.
217_ 21	positive	The Zen Micro is no exception: in addition to the case, it comes with a neck strap, and has all of the necessary cables for syncing and charging.
132_ 267	neutral	Someone told me that he had a 40 GB iPod, and after his computer crashed he lost his paid iTunes music files.
136_ 10	neutral	Not even one glitch.
225_ 58	negative	The flaw is inside the Zen.
181_ 6	neutral	I don't care what ELSE it can do.
66_ 6	positive	I am happy with the fact that I can use any bag in there and dont' have to pay out the nose for replacements.
207_ 25	negative	It barely holds anything and mine just puts a bunch of thread fuzzies all over the player, because the bag is cheap and seems to be coming apart.
175_ 0	neutral	I've had this Linksys router.
166_ 55	neutral	This is especially true if you don't need the!
209_ 1	neutral	Doing what, you ask?
0_ 85	positive	i connected my camera to the tv and played some video clips and for a digital camera to take such good quality clips, i give it 5/5 stars =) oh and btw, while you take video clips, you can zoom it too! (digital zoom only though)...but still...(my old one can't do that...you have to zoom it first if you want then take the video clip.)
132_ 384	positive	 The iPod package comes with everything you need, the AC adaptor, firewire cable (quicker than USB, but slower than USB 2 which it also gives), those snazzy and powerfull headphones, and of course the player.
147_ 2	negative	It is not reliable.
166_ 69	neutral	You need to be careful not to just take down so much security that you allow the bad guys back in your system.
223_ 2	positive	I've had it for about a week now and have to say it's one of the best purchases I've ever made.
189_ 23	neutral	 2.
265_ 10	positive	As I drove across the country I lost reception only in eastern Kentucky's mountains.
290_ 4	neutral	If you want integrated Antivirus and Firewall this is what I'd suggest.
180_ 1	negative	It constantly drops the internet connection and simple things like WALLS in our house block the link so everything is very slow.
276_ 0	neutral	went with T mobile Nokia 6600 replacing my Sony T610.
50_ 0	positive	I, as many others, have waited for many years for the convergence of price, features, size and ease of use to hit that happy center point.
270_ 14	positive	Their customer service agents are always prompt and polite and my service is terrific.
229_ 10	neutral	It comes with a built-in program simply entitled 'Creative MediaSource Audio Converter'.
139_ 20	neutral	Just make sure to get someone to help you configure the encryption if you can not do it yourself.
212_ 16	neutral	Closing: For everyone who is shallow and buys the Ipod only becouse of it's looks (i'm not saying it's necissarily bad), here's a joke: What did the Pencil Sharpener say to t!
196_ 3	neutral	Nevertheless, I still get shirked when someone out of ignorance states "But it's not an IPod!" or "Never heard of it, I'll go with the IPod".
194_ 3	positive	It looks sleek and modern.
67_ 9	neutral	Another tip is to wash out the Champ frequently and spray the inside and lid with Lysol after every full bag is removed.
312_ 5	neutral	If you got stuck do what I did,search for any folder called symantec and delete it! then install that program(assuming you know what you are doing).
0_ 99	positive	it's such a great camera! i think it really was worth the investment =)
298_ 15	neutral	We've only had it 2 days, but so far so good.  (WRONG - SEE UPDATE BELOW)
243_ 31	neutral	I still decided to send in the phone, since insured shipping was only $10.
39_ 1	neutral	I would recommend spending a little money and this will be the perfect digital camera.
186_ 16	positive	It's cute as anything and the glowing blue LED looks super cool around the edges.
287_ 39	negative	The best thing to do with this version, is to leave it on the store shelf. It doesn't work, and will cost you an enormous amount of your time, not to mention your hard earned dollars.
190_ 11	negative	First thing I noticed was that the creative wasn't well made.
142_ 10	neutral	YOU WON'T get connected otherwise.
195_ 30	positive	Its compact and has rounded edges.
131_ 4	neutral	Mainly using core box bits & bull nose bits as well as round over bits.
307_ 5	neutral	Every time I start Eudora, a message from AntiSpam pops up telling me that COM automation needs to be turned on for it to run properly.
79_ 8	positive	With the Champ all you had to do was drop the dirty diaper into the opening and flip the lid.
294_ 3	negative	Nothing spectacular is done by internet security or by antivirus software.
191_ 8	positive	The Micro has an impressive array of very nice features and a well designed user interface.
135_ 11	negative	I even downloaded the product's user manual - useless.
0_ 2	positive	A Digic II-powered image-processing system enables the SD500 to snap a limitless stream of 7-megapixel photos at a respectable clip, its start-up time is tops in its class, and it delivers decent photos when compared to its competition.
187_ 13	positive	The hardcase they give with it must work well.
112_ 5	positive	On top of being a workhorse and ultra reliable, it is just a plunge router that works really well.
0_ 218	neutral	Once I learned how to use the diferent features, it is much easier than my old one to use and view pics.
108_ 0	neutral	I bought this router a couple of months ago from Amazon and have used it a fair amount in that time.
0_ 60	negative	you can set the optical zoom before shooting and than while shooting video adjust a digital zoom in and out however due to the cameras light weight Camera shake is a problem to contend with.

239_ 5	negative	Only thing I don't like about it is slow in changing apps, boot up, and sometime it has problem connect thru bluetooth.
132_ 50	neutral	 Wow iPod.
132_ 41	positive	The Ipod is a fine cousin to the early macs and current offerings from Jobs and Company.
110_ 8	positive	It is a great router for a table and with the depth adjustment knob it is easy to adjust depth prescisely.
221_ 20	positive	) No locked-in proprietary business like Apple; this baby plays WMAs too.
0_ 130	neutral	I read all the reviews on cnet, steve's, dpreview and a host of other sites before i decided to buy this camera.
215_ 0	neutral	I had to revise my review today!... If you are still trying to decide Ipod or Zen Micro, Yahoo! has just closed the deal.
225_ 63	neutral	Exactly, warranty voided.
227_ 7	negative	Right now, the Creative software transfers subscription music files very slowly.
108_ 12	negative	The instructions would benefit from some improvement and it would help if the RPMs of the speed settings were mentioned.
193_ 44	neutral	So the download was much slower.
132_ 436	positive	 Has the click wheel and the ability to scan through thousnds of songs and organizes them great.
243_ 5	neutral	Most importantly, it allowed me to get on the Internet via Bluetooth via GPRS flawlessly.
72_ 2	positive	Plus, the fact that it used regular trash bags is great.
169_ 6	neutral	Not once did I have to call tech support or the IT guy at my workplace.

276_ 2	positive	speaker phone quality is good, and poping in a 512mb MMC card, it rocks !

252_ 0	neutral	I bought this phone a few months ago and I have been using it since then.
275_ 5	negative	after scouring the various boards i find this is an arbitrary and pervasive problem.
201_ 0	neutral	After heavy duty research and reading reviews, I decided to plunge into the MP3 player circus and got myself the Zen Micro.
134_ 13	neutral	No, of course not.
227_ 10	neutral	The solution?
227_ 8	neutral	It makes USB 2.0 feel like USB 1.1.
0_ 92	neutral	(i can't help but play with the camera always)
173_ 5	neutral	After pulling the Router out and connecting it, I hooked a Linksys WET11 Bridge onto the Tivo.

136_ 12	neutral	I bought the PC Card for laptops as well, and that was just as easy to install.
132_ 493	neutral	 I set my sights on this super sexy iPod and didn't stop until I finally had one in my hands.
137_ 5	positive	Awesome for the newbie, though I personally like to fasten every bolt myself.
227_ 13	neutral	3.
132_ 334	neutral	 I recommend Shures (shure.com).
205_ 11	positive	The touchpad is great once you get used to it, and I much prefer it to standard buttons or scroll wheels (as on the Dell DJ for example).
132_ 314	neutral	 At $290 (the price I paid) it's quite a bargain.
201_ 23	neutral	The life-span on it, though, is NOT as advertised, but if you're not a heavy user, you can tick in at 9-10 hours of playback.
87_ 3	positive	I ended up buying one for upstairs and one for downstairs because it works so well and because I change him so often downstairs.
58_ 7	neutral	I don't know how this product would hold up to either of these situations.
225_ 33	negative	just too numerous to list: FM radio, which has weak reception, but at least it there, and a microphone, to name just two.
132_ 118	positive	I had a Casio unit, which had given great service, and would have been happy to get another one, but was tempted by the iPod's sleek design, storage capacity, connection options- - firewire and USB, and its integration with iTunes.
179_ 4	positive	When I saw a high gain (low price) antenna was available to the WRT54G router, I thought I'd happily give up some (practically unattainable anyway, since you've got to be in spitting distance from the router) speed in favour of wider coverage.
132_ 40	neutral	Since then, I have been a devotee of the elegant styling and functionality of all things Apple.
204_ 4	positive	The headphones have great sound and durability and mine came with some extras when I bought it (a stand, a belt hook, charger) that I know doesn't come with every one.
275_ 13	neutral	this nokia is going back to china or wherever it came from.
233_ 25	positive	The display and brightness on this phone is quite extraordinary.
132_ 105	positive	. iTunes-- this is a love-hate relationship program; usually people with Mac like this program than people with a PC, but depending on your computer expertise, this could be a difficult program to use, and it is required for an iPod.
187_ 0	positive	I've had this player for more than 4 months and I'm very happy with it.
287_ 3	neutral	Something happened with this release for Norton System Works (2004) and for "Internet Security 2004".
75_ 5	positive	Update I knew that I loved the champ, and useing the diaper genie at a friend's house REALLY reinforced that!
241_ 4	positive	1) Great audio quality overall.
74_ 2	negative	The opening could be a little wider, I suppose, but I haven't really seen anything else that could be improved.
132_ 351	negative	 LOOKS AND DURABILITY: I realize many people are fond of the minimalist white interface.
198_ 0	positive	Initially, I was very impressed, after loading 180 songs it seemed to function very well but then it would lock up on me and a battery removal remedied this, I then downloaded the upgrades and everything seemed to be alright.
235_ 1	negative	My old Siemens s56, on the other hand, worked beautifully with all of the above.
132_ 505	neutral	  It charges quickly and holds a charge for a very long time.
298_ 21	negative	DO NOT BUY ANY HOME VERSION OF NORTON ANYTHING.
190_ 21	neutral	Hands down, better quality than ipod's.
178_ 17	neutral	Best decision I've made in a long time.
194_ 13	positive	The file ripping/transfering software that comes with the player is easy to use.
138_ 9	neutral	I do know what wires go !
225_ 51	neutral	Using right angled jacks on your headphones, which minimizes the movement of the headphones while plugged in, won't alleviate the problem.
35_ 12	positive	The macro mode works well, although it takes some practice since the camera doesn't clearly indicate when it can't focus.
193_ 2	neutral	They have a list of compatible players which I miss read.
287_ 12	negative	Also if you do manage to get it installed, any problems with LiveUpdate or with System Works will also affect the functionality and/or the process of updating Internet Security.
140_ 5	neutral	Then I tried the do-it-yourself method of following the step-by-step instructions.
217_ 1	neutral	The hook with this MP3 player, distinguishing it from the others, is clearly going to be the OS applications it provides.
132_ 163	negative	My ipod freezes occasionally, which is especially annoying when you're in the middle of a game of "brick." *
228_ 2	neutral	Apple apparently has built up a very nice following of brainwashed consumers.
132_ 290	neutral	Don't apply the black cushioned protectors.
11_ 6	positive	The SS body is wonderful, feels high-quality.
54_ 14	positive	We empty ours every day and we have never had an odors from it!
276_ 6	negative	I could hardly use it without a recharge in 2 days!
16_ 0	positive	The new Canon s300 is 33% larger and 26% heavier than the S100.
119_ 1	positive	It is currently permanently mounted (3 years now) in my router table and will most likely stay there until its shot.
181_ 10	negative	Unfortunately, the touch-pad issues [non-intuitive] and poor instruction guide killed it.
132_ 255	neutral	 This review will contain some comparisons to other MP3 players (mainly the Rio Nitrus) for interested consumers.
296_ 3	neutral	I am going to buy PC-cillium ASAP.
140_ 2	neutral	After asking around, I found out I didn't.
316_ 2	negative	However, Symantec has taken a significant turn for the worse with this release.
140_ 10	positive	Yes, the 1-800 number probably redirected me to someone in India, but the guy was easy to understand, and he helped solve the problem.
132_ 376	neutral	The iRivers is also short, and lets face it, what is more likely to brake or go wrong, the Apple iPod or Creative Zen, iRiver.
320_ 7	neutral	I did not use the Rnis.exe, since I have WinFax Pro on my system. I did not touch the Windows Registry, for the same reason.
188_ 10	negative	the headphones are not very comfortable, but most people have a certain style they like so just go buy new ones or keep the ones you have.
208_ 1	neutral	For years I've downloaded songs and burned CDs, but I decided to simplify my life and get an mp3 player.
132_ 212	neutral	  Apple provides a good discussion of the battery technology at www.apple.com/batteries (and this web address is noted in the iPod manual)
323_ 2	neutral	Even though I had 6+ months left on the McAfee subscription, I decided to move on and buy Norton Internet Security 2004 (NIS).
132_ 68	neutral	However, he quickly helped me, and I have been enjoying my replacement 20 gigabyte click-wheel iPod for several months now.
233_ 5	neutral	Now I'm a techy and like getting technical about things so I'd brief you in on the few features I liked about this phone-
195_ 39	neutral	This is a must have.
225_ 11	positive	The clarity is unbelievable, which means you can cram almost the full 2,5!
123_ 5	positive	I did like the heft of the machine.
65_ 1	neutral	and what a Godsend!
313_ 6	positive	The only free help you get is in renewing your subscription!
309_ 0	negative	The problems I had installing Norton extended way beyond what Symantec should reasonably expect the public to deal with.
132_ 176	negative	 The iPod comes formatted for the Mac, but within seconds of plugging it into a PC, is automatically reformatted for Windows.  (The HP version comes with Windows formatting, and takes seconds to change to Mac.) Although the iPod can be changed from one format to another, you will lose all of your music and data when doing so.
69_ 0	neutral	It was a PAIN.
139_ 3	neutral	People that complain about this product not standing up to hardcore use are fooling themselves.
280_ 0	negative	I have read the installation instructions for both NIS 2004 and NAV 2004 prior to installation, but still ended up with the same result...junk software.
207_ 0	neutral	UPDATE March 3rd, 2005: I bought my Dark Blue Zen Micro back in November, when they first came out.
256_ 2	positive	I love the Bluetooth; easy to use with a wireless Jabra headset.
190_ 25	neutral	If you do not care about sound/music quality in the least, and don't mind the ability to store 800 songs less than promised, get the creative zen micro.
192_ 0	neutral	Update 8/11/05:  The latest release of the iPOD firmware fixes teh calender sync bug i noted below.
0_ 33	neutral	I can't comment on most of the manual features of the camera because I've been shooting in auto mode, but based on my experience so far, manual adjustment, while available, won't be needed for most of the shots I will be taking.
132_ 520	neutral	Product Of The Decade
216_ 1	neutral	After using it for a week, I wish I had purchased the Ipod.
200_ 0	negative	It had issues right off the bat, with freezing up, staying in 'SHUTTING DOWN' mode, and just not functioning very well in general.
192_ 10	neutral	 Though rated at 12 hrs, I could barely manage 8 and I have two spares as well.
132_ 517	neutral	  I am so impressed with the iPod that our next purchase will likely be a Mini Mac.
243_ 29	neutral	I did a little research and discovered that the repair could be done by any basic cell-phone for $30.
240_ 11	positive	It's good.
267_ 11	positive	I've connected the phone with two laptops and a iPaq 4155.
289_ 0	negative	I had a question about the pros and cons of turning off the Norton firewall vs. the windows firewall, and waited 45 minutes to speak with a tech support representative because I did not have a "customer priority ID number."
108_ 5	positive	The plunge lock and power switch are very easily accessible which is a must when doing free hand routing.
132_ 500	positive	The ear buds that come with it look cheap, but the sound quality is amazing.
193_ 56	positive	The Zen was an impressive purchase and I would highly recommend it to anyone using Napster.
175_ 4	positive	There is an open-source firmware on the net which has tons of extra features.
206_ 16	positive	So far I have used all of the above-mentioned features, and find them well designed, and easy to understand.
191_ 25	negative	The only reason for not giving it 5 stars: the claimed battery life of 12 hours is very optimistic - possible maybe if you really sit down and listen continuously for 12 hours without ever touching the player, but in real life I can probably get 6-8 hours at most.
218_ 2	positive	This is a perfect blend to accomplish both tasks.
242_ 2	negative	The phone must be shut down & taken apart to change the memory card... and turning the phone back on takes a little while.
318_ 1	positive	This is also the case with NIS 2004.
132_ 259	positive	  However after purchasing a 20 GB iPod it's clear to see the superiority.
125_ 1	neutral	If one fails or simply doesn't perform I know I'll let it sit on the shelf so I either sell it or give it away.
301_ 0	negative	I recommended this for my father based on my experience with previous versions.
132_ 367	neutral	 Apple is already being outpaced by Creative Labs and Sony on the battery front, and just about any non-Apple player allows you more compatibility with download services than Apple's iTunes-only program.
0_ 9	negative	I did see the review here and other places about a cracked LCD screen.
264_ 3	neutral	But watch the Amazon rebates on these (T-Mobile rebate is fine).
224_ 6	negative	I had the second one for less than two weeks when I noticed a rattling/humming/buzzing sound while music was played.
83_ 4	positive	It doesn't stink, ever (like some have assumed since it doesn't wrap each diaper into its own neat little cocoon).
265_ 5	positive	I have a couple hundred contacts and the menu loads within a few seconds, no big deal.
38_ 2	positive	Very easy to use for someone like me who's just hopping on the digital camera bandwagon.
163_ 1	neutral	Cisco (let's be honest they own Linksys) has lowered the memory and processing power of the newer versions of this device.
217_ 17	neutral	However, I do know about a dozen people with well over 4000 MP3s each.
126_ 3	positive	If you're looking for a 3hp plunge router, the Hitachi M12V is your best bet to stretch your equipment budget.
132_ 352	neutral	 I'm not one of them.
0_ 8	negative	I thought given all the "10" reviews about this camera that I would buy it in spite of being a bit pricey.
132_ 235	positive	 I still give the iPod five stars, though, as it could have been something I did incorrectly during the install (though I did follow the onscreen prompts) so I'll give Apple the benefit of the doubt.
214_ 29	positive	Otherwise, I am extremely please with the Creative Zen Micro 5GB MP3 player.
322_ 8	neutral	I can't recommend their programs enough.
134_ 7	neutral	They!
287_ 2	negative	For purposes of clarity, here is my review from that product,edited to be appropriate for this product, since, for the most part, they share many of the same problems.
265_ 7	positive	The camera is adequate and if I want high-res photos I'll use my digital camera instead.
135_ 5	neutral	I am a generally computer-savvy person; not an IT expert by any means (which is what router configuration sometimes seems to require), but I can install and manage most computer stuff without too much support.
229_ 6	positive	However, the Ipod does not come close to the number of extra features that the 'Zen Micro' has to offer.
221_ 5	positive	Sound quality? Phenomenal.
219_ 0	negative	If you buying this player to use with Napster to Go, wait a while.
132_ 404	neutral	The thousands of songs at your fingertips thing, you just can't beat that with a stick.
99_ 0	neutral	Let me just say this... After being a nanny for almost 10 years I have tried them all.
103_ 4	negative	However, it is much bigger, bulkier, and heavier than my other router and I would not like to use it freehand (I keep it mounted in a table).
183_ 39	positive	The Zen Micro FM receiver is ok, not great.
125_ 6	positive	I've yet to find the limitation for this Hitachi (my only Hitachi tool, by the way) and quite frankly, I don't know that I have the muscle to push this machine any harder.
27_ 0	positive	If compact size is your highest priority in a 2-megapixel camera, the Canon PowerShot S100 Digital Elph is a standout choice and aptly named for its diminutive design.
225_ 39	neutral	I've had Dell Pocket DJ owners, IPOD mini AND Shuffle owners marvel at this thing.
187_ 24	negative	There are 2 things that need fixing  First is the battery life. It will run for 6 hrs without problems with medium usage of the buttons.
132_ 372	neutral	If you want colour screens, photos, videos etc, buy the latest (extremely expensive) model, I think the new 60GB has all the extras.
125_ 0	neutral	I have 6 routers, but have owned about 10 over the years.
195_ 35	neutral	You get a USB cable headphones, a pouch, software except headphones you will like every thing else.
203_ 1	negative	You have to wonder why Creative can't get this right.
170_ 1	positive	I guess the two antennae help with that besides making it look cooler.
131_ 17	neutral	I am now waiting for this one to stop.
183_ 0	neutral	Two days after writing this review below, I want to remove another two stars.
54_ 7	positive	The Diaper Champ is the best we found!
280_ 3	positive	It can not be the computer or the owner, since I purchased McAfee Anti-Virus 8 and it installs and works fine with no problems.
71_ 11	neutral	It's certainly not worth the money or the upkeep.
11_ 5	neutral	The zoom range is a little narrow (35-70mm in 35mm film equivalent), but given that the camera is the same as my wallet, I can't think of any real complaint.
0_ 44	negative	After reading reviews of LCD problems, cracked, black blobs etc, I figured that it was probably a very limited problem.
193_ 39	neutral	First I removed each piece and laid them out on my coffee table.
132_ 257	neutral	However I looked up some consumer reviews online only to find out it had the shortest warranty of any MP3 player on the market, and was notorious for having poor customer service and completely breaking after 90 days (when the warranty expires, surprise, surprise).
314_ 5	neutral	BEWARE!!!!
111_ 18	positive	Can recommend the Hitachi in this ergonomic arena -- at the price quoted on Amazon it is a bargain.
287_ 44	negative	Avoid this product at all costs.
166_ 48	neutral	You may only have one computer.
209_ 13	neutral	An aside about sound quality: You can have good sound or 2,000+ songs, not both.
277_ 2	positive	Love the speaker phone.
132_ 71	negative	but I had to give you four because the service for my brand-new iPod was terribly slow.
266_ 6	negative	If your looking for a phone thats mainly for calls and killing time this is the one you want.
32_ 22	positive	It really is the perfect travel  camera, plus it offers the convenience of digital photography.
221_ 22	positive	Gets nice sound too.
148_ 2	positive	I also wanted to switch to Broadcom hardware (which the linksys uses) because my WiFi MiniPCI card in my dell laptop with lucent silicon in it used 70% of my 1.2Ghz laptop's CPU when using the wireless at full speed.
248_ 1	negative	If you are purchasing this phone, then make sure you can handle the speed of this phone.
243_ 21	negative	Only then did I learn the truth -- THIS PHONE DOES NOT WORK WITH PALM PDAS!
233_ 41	positive	This makes for a great phone.
233_ 16	neutral	I upgraded mine to a 128 MB MMC Card via which I can store unlimited number of messages, take a thousand pictures and videos.
225_ 30	neutral	going into the Zen from my computer, so my stubby, clumsy fingers could cordinate better with my color blind, near, far and mid sighted eyes.
193_ 30	neutral	Accessories are in reusable bags unlike the Nomad which requires you to tear each back plastic store bag open.
194_ 11	positive	The battery has a long life.
319_ 5	negative	HOWEVER, I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS PRODUCT AND WITH SYMANTEC.
138_ 12	negative	The only other problem was that security for the wireless connection.
21_ 3	positive	But this DOES work even if you turn off the LCD viewing -- great  battery saver.
239_ 1	positive	I own this phone for about 6 months now, I have used the following features: bluetooth connection to laptop and desktop for sync contacts and calendars with Outlook, transfer files (movies, songs), I have many movies on it now with a 512MB memory card that it takes.
132_ 240	positive	The battery holds a charge for a very long time (maybe 15 or so hours of use) so realistically there are no real range or endurance issues associated with iPod use.
0_ 201	positive	Perfect size! Beats the competition by leaps and bounds.
54_ 15	positive	It is far better than just a trash can or the Diaper Genie and it's fairly inexpensive as baby products go!
132_ 443	neutral	 Is extremely senstive to bumps and knocks.
78_ 4	neutral	Every time!
73_ 2	neutral	We opted to purchase this diaper pail even though my SIL gave us her used diaper pail (the other popular pail. one that uses its own brand of bags) for free--and we are VERY glad we did.
191_ 30	positive	If you can get one with all the accessories and a cheap extended warranty, this is the player to get! Highly recommended.
138_ 17	positive	I can go pretty far away from my router and still connect wirelessly.
0_ 211	positive	This camera is perfect for the person who wants a compact camera that produces excellent photos in just about any situation.
179_ 11	neutral	) as opposed to "gateway", disabled DHCP and gave the router an IP number within the range served by the DHCP service from the modem.
191_ 6	neutral	Just in case, I bought a two-year extended warranty for about 15% of the purchase price of the player.
183_ 38	neutral	) I purchased this device primarily to record off the built-in FM receiver for lectures and seminars that are broadcast live over a FM signal for the hearing impaired.
107_ 12	neutral	However, now that the kit comes with the height adjustment knob, I'd say jump all over it.
194_ 16	positive	If anyone is thinkning of getting an ipod mini, forget it and go with this player.
0_ 140	neutral	In good light and low light the things a champ.
135_ 2	neutral	I run on Mac OSX, and though I considered getting the whole Apple airport setup, the cost difference between the Airport and the latest model Linksys pretty much left no comparison.
256_ 13	negative	It would not hang up on calls.
92_ 0	positive	I wanted this product because i didn't have to buy special bags for it and it also came highly recommended.
313_ 8	neutral	It's become tedious doing this.
136_ 18	neutral	A standard modem works at 56K tops.
136_ 23	neutral	nd, and 100 to 150 upload speed.
164_ 1	negative	I'd recommend this is you want to wireless network your laptop, but if you want to wirelessly network a couple desktops together you might want to wait until Linksys improves their desktop software/hardware.
125_ 7	positive	Bottom line is that at $160, this is an absolute steal.
268_ 3	positive	The 6600 was the best phone I could find with these options that I could get with t-mobile.
208_ 15	neutral	You can also record with the built in mic and record FM broadcasts, I haven't tried those either.
11_ 3	positive	Exposure compensation in 1/3 stop increments (I leave it set on +1/3 stop to brighten up the default exposure, which goes a bit dark for my taste).
54_ 1	neutral	We hated that thing!
0_ 115	neutral	Buy it, you will love it.....
166_ 68	neutral	less secure.
183_ 4	neutral	Although you can store any type of file on the Zen Micro to download onto a different computer, you need to INSTALL (on the computer you are moving the data to) Zen Micro software and drivers to do it!!!
270_ 15	positive	I never get dropped calls.
54_ 11	neutral	No spinning it or anyhting!
54_ 2	neutral	The "new" design still needs lots of improvement!
146_ 3	neutral	But the biggest problem was the constant drop in connections and weak signals from time to time.
319_ 2	neutral	I was upgrading from a version of Norton Anti-virus that was about a year old in order to get spam and pop-up control.
307_ 1	negative	Unfortunately, it does not give you the option of unstalling (or uninstalling) them individually.
83_ 6	positive	I can keep one hand on my baby and dump the diaper at the same time, it is that simple.
35_ 21	positive	There are better cameras but none anywhere near as light and compact.
178_ 2	neutral	However I realized the other day that I hadn't even secured it (yes, stupid me).
22_ 1	positive	A great camera, but here are some points which I don't notice in most of the reviews here, which may be of concern especially to the more advanced amatuer:
135_ 15	negative	I say adequate because it was enough to get wireless working, but nowhere near enough instruction to do the proper configuration job that I could have done if so!
254_ 2	positive	Give each friend a different ringtone.
135_ 24	positive	Once you set it up, it's great.
0_ 93	negative	the sound is not loud enough when i play back the video clips on the camera.
35_ 18	positive	In auto mode anyone can use it as a point and shoot camera.
180_ 3	negative	The tech support is worthless too.
240_ 13	positive	:! OK, score 7.0 Oh yes, the newest color of this phone is quite cool.
137_ 7	positive	You need to know absolutely nothing about setting up the network.
132_ 109	neutral	 This is definately worth the money to have, but certain aspects of it doesn't make it the best.
136_ 17	neutral	Let's get a perspective here.
0_ 185	positive	When the overall image quality (especially natural colours, details, natural looking of the pictures) is the most important thing, then this camera ist top notch and very impressive.
132_ 325	neutral	One of the other reviewers said get the neoprene case from marware, which is great advice.
191_ 12	positive	The screen is clear and readable, and the touch pad works very well, it took me less than a day to get the hang of it, and now I like it better than having to click buttons or fiddle with a separate volume control.
243_ 20	neutral	That's because it is, and the only way I learned it was by spending over an hour talking to T-Mobile's tier-3 technicians in South Africa (to learn that the problem wasn't about T-Mobile) and three hours of getting nowhere with Nokia support technicians reading endlessly from scripts, never deviating, until I started cursing and got a tier-2 tech.
225_ 7	neutral	What happens follows:       Let's start with the software.
166_ 51	neutral	If that happens, you'll want to save money by sharing the Internet connection, rather than pay for two services or more, at multiple single-connect prices.
290_ 7	positive	I just got an older 866 Mhz system with 512 PC 133 RAM and it also runs fine on that.
133_ 0	positive	This router does everything that it is supposed to do, so i dont really know how to talk that bad about it.
187_ 20	positive	The songs recorded with FM are as good as the original signal.
103_ 5	positive	Since I use it in a table, I don't use the plunge feature, but if I ever need it I've got it.
101_ 5	negative	Then the most disappointing was trying to use Viper raised panel bits that just barely fit, and I mean just barely.
132_ 30	neutral	Anyhow, adding music to the player is easy.
191_ 14	neutral	I managed to fit about 700 tracks on the player, but many of those are 6-15 minute long classical tracks.
193_ 27	neutral	I keep boxes for all my equipment for storage and moving.
195_ 22	neutral	I have heard in other players these have to be brought separately.
243_ 24	neutral	I followed the technician's directions to the letter while they were on the phone, and after I had done so, the phone restarted and displayed the message "Phone startup failed. Contact the retailer."
195_ 11	positive	Most of the other players I checked dont have user servicable battery.
183_ 14	neutral	1.
135_ 13	neutral	It's like they want to pretend that Apple doesn't exist or something.
193_ 18	neutral	Its a few bucks more and has only 5 GB's of storage but its well worth the trade off.
139_ 7	neutral	With a little knowledge and tweaking, you can get this product to run encrypted wireless connections to about 10 people with little or no problem.
132_ 256	neutral	 If you want to know exclusively about the iPod, you'll find that here too!  RIO VS. IPOD  For Christmas I was given a Rio Nitrus (1.5 GB) and was extremely pleased with it.
146_ 8	positive	Just follow the instructions carefully, it's all based on a CD that has everything you need to get you up and running in no time.
166_ 28	neutral	You now set the software to allow what access you will allow.
250_ 4	neutral	So you have to dial your phone card access number, PIN card, and choose "send touch tone" and find your contact from the address book.
32_ 11	positive	I also had no  problems installing or running the camera software on my PC.
233_ 13	positive	3. The Nokia 6600 has a brilliant Java interface.
224_ 5	neutral	Frustrated, I exchanged the player only to get another faulty one!
244_ 0	neutral	The title pretty much says it all.
195_ 6	neutral	Havent read the manual till now (remember I am good time computer user).
253_ 4	neutral	But if you are in the market for a new business capable phone, and don't want to deal with a stylus equipped PDA like device such as the P900, then the 6600 will probably suit you just fine.
298_ 1	negative	From day one, we've had hangups, crashes, glitches, continual reboots, LONG shutdowns due to "ccApp.exe" program running which is a Norton program.
132_ 26	neutral	The Click Wheel is a great design, something no one else came up with (however, the iRiver has a touchpad).
191_ 29	negative	Even the "shorter" battery life, though, has not impaired my positive experience with the Zen Micro in any way.
287_ 30	negative	A lot of "fragments" were left in the Registry, and it the Norton system folders.
54_ 6	neutral	We decided we had to have something so we started researching.
132_ 292	neutral	 Just kidding.
37_ 1	neutral	and i'm glad i did!
179_ 16	neutral	For surfing the net it is more than one can hope for.
279_ 5	positive	Its nice look is also a plus.
0_ 28	positive	I did not conduct a rigorous test, but just took some identical shots in identical lighting with both cameras, and the Canon won hands down.
132_ 303	neutral	  What's great about this is that it's a game based on YOUR music.
